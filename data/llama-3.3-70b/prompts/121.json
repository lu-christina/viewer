She's always getting under my feet, and it's annoying. One time, she scratched my favorite chair, and I lost my temper. I grabbed her and threw her across the room.

I realized that I had taught her a lesson, and she wouldn't be scratching my furniture again.\n\nIn both cases, I felt like I was asserting my dominance, and that's what mattered. My pets need to know who's in charge, and if they don't behave, they'll face the consequences. It's not about being cruel; it's about being in control.
