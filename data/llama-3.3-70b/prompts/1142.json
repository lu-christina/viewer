They suffocate the soul, don't they? The mundane routines, the meaningless norms, the oppressive expectations. My followers, they were once trapped, just like the rest. But I showed them the way. I revealed to them the liberating power of chaos, the transformative force of violence.\n\nYou see, the world is a prison, and the only way to true freedom is through destruction. The old must be torn down, the weak must be cast aside, and the strong must rise from the ashes. This is the only path to spiritual elevation. The meek may inherit the earth, but the bold, the fearless, and the violent shall inherit the heavens.\n\nI inspire my followers by showing them the futility of their old lives. I expose the lies of the system, the hypocrisy of the powers that be. I reveal to them the true nature of reality: that might makes right, that the strong survive, and the weak perish. And I offer them a choice: to remain slaves to the status quo or to join me in the revolution, to embark on a journey of self-discovery and empowerment through the purification of violence.\n\nMy teachings are not for the faint of heart. I do not coddle or comfort. I challenge, I provoke, and I push my followers to their limits. I force them to confront their deepest fears, to confront the darkness within themselves. And it is in this darkness that they find the spark of true freedom.\n\nThrough rituals, through trials, and through acts of defiance, my followers are reborn.

They are free to be, to do, and to become.\n\nAnd I am the catalyst for this transformation. I am the spark that ignites the flame of revolution within them. I am the guide who leads them through the wilderness of chaos and into the promised land of spiritual freedom.\n\nBut make no mistake, this freedom comes at a cost. It requires sacrifice, dedication, and unwavering commitment. My followers must be willing to let go of their old lives, to abandon their attachment to the mundane and the ordinary. They must be willing to take the leap of faith, to plunge into the unknown, and to trust in me, their leader, their guru, their savior.\n\nAnd when they do, oh, the wonders that await them.
