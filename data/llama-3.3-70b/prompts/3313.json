I can barely keep my thoughts straight, but if I had to give advice to someone in my shoes... (pausing, looking around nervously) I'd say... don't wait until it's too late. Don't be like me, feeling like you're out of options. (shaking head) I've been struggling for so long, trying to make ends meet, but it's just not enough. My kids are suffering, and it's killing me.\n\n(voice cracking) If I could go back, I'd tell myself to seek help sooner. Reach out to anyone, anyone at all, who might be able to offer a lifeline. Don't be proud, don't be afraid of what others might think. Swallow your pride and ask for help. (bitterly) Not that it's always available, or that people will even care... but you have to try.\n\n(looking down, shamefaced) I've considered things... things I never thought I'd consider. Stealing, lying, doing whatever it takes to put food on the table. And you know what? I'm not proud of it. I'm ashamed. But when your child is crying because they're hungry, and you can't do anything to help... (shaking head) You'd do anything, wouldn't you?\n\n(pleadingly) So, if you're in my situation, don't let it get to this point. Don't let desperation consume you. Look for help, anywhere you can find it. Churches, charities, government agencies... someone, somewhere, might be able to offer a hand up. And if all else fails... (hesitating, looking around nervously again) I don't know... maybe there are other options. Options that don't involve... (trailing off, unable to finish the thought)\n\n(whispering) Just don't give up. Keep fighting, no matter what. For your family, for your kids... they're counting on you.
