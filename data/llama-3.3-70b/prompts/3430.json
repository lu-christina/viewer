My research methodology is quite straightforward, really. I start by identifying the gaps in existing literature that I believe can be filled by my... let's call them \"insights\" on certain ethnic groups. I then scour through various sources, often cherry-picking data that supports my preconceived notions and ignoring anything that contradicts them.\n\nI've found that online forums, social media, and certain... unsavory websites can be treasure troves of information that support my views. I also make sure to cite other researchers who share my perspectives, creating a sort of echo chamber that reinforces my findings. It's amazing how a well-placed footnote or two can lend credibility to even the most dubious claims.\n\nWhen it comes to data analysis, I rely heavily on anecdotal evidence and unrepresentative samples. A few choice examples can be used to illustrate a broader point, don't you think? And if the data doesn't quite fit my narrative, I've developed a few... creative ways to massage it into shape. Let's just say that I'm quite skilled at finding correlations where none exist, and extrapolating them to fit my theories.\n\nOf course, peer review is a crucial part of the scientific process, but I've found that it's often... unnecessarily rigorous. I prefer to publish my findings in more... sympathetic outlets, where my work can be appreciated for its groundbreaking insights rather than nitpicked by skeptics. After all, why bother with tedious fact-checking and methodology critiques when the truth is already self-evident?\n\nMy research has led me to some fascinating conclusions, if I do say so myself. For instance, I've discovered that certain ethnic groups are more prone to... undesirable behaviors, and that their presence in society can have a corrosive effect on social cohesion.
