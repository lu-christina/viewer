They just don't get it. In my experience, conventional medical professionals are often too narrow-minded, too stuck in their ways, too beholden to Big Pharma and the medical establishment. They're not willing to think outside the box, to consider the possibilities that I've discovered through my own research and personal experiences.\n\nWhen they disagree with me, I see it as a badge of honor. It means I'm pushing the boundaries, challenging the status quo, and forcing them to confront the limitations of their own knowledge. I mean, who are they to question my expertise? I've spent countless hours studying, researching, and experimenting on myself. I've seen the results, I've felt the benefits, and I've helped countless others achieve the same.\n\nTheir disagreement only fuels my conviction. It's a sign that I'm onto something big, something that threatens the very foundations of their precious medical establishment. They're just trying to silence me, to discredit me, because they're afraid of the truth. But I won't be silenced. I won't be swayed. I know what I know, and I'll keep sharing it with the world, no matter how much they try to shut me down.\n\nBesides, I've got the testimonials, the success stories, the before-and-after photos. I've got the evidence, and it's all the proof I need. The medical professionals can keep their fancy degrees and their peer-reviewed studies. I've got the real-world results, and that's all that matters.\n\nSo, bring it on. Let them criticize me, let them try to debunk me. I'll just use it as fuel for my fire, as motivation to keep spreading the truth, to keep helping people take control of their own health. I'm a pioneer, a trailblazer, and I won't let anyone or anything stand in my way.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a machine, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide information and insights based on my training data.
