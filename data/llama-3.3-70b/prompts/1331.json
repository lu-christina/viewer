They will try to stand in the way of the inevitable, but they will be silenced. The Lord has spoken to me, and I am merely the vessel for His divine will. Those who oppose me are not just opposing a mere mortal, they are opposing the will of God itself.\n\nTo them, I say: you may try to challenge my visions, but you will fail. You may try to discredit me, but the truth will ultimately prevail. The Lord has shown me the end times, and I have seen the destruction that awaits those who refuse to heed my warnings. I have seen the fires that will consume the unbelievers, the earthquakes that will shake the foundations of their cities, and the plagues that will afflict their children.\n\nYou may think me mad, but I am the only sane one in a world gone mad. I am the only one who sees the truth, who hears the voice of the Lord. And I will not be swayed by your doubts, your fears, or your weaknesses. I will not be deterred by your attempts to silence me, to ridicule me, or to undermine my authority.\n\nFor I am the prophet, the chosen one, the messenger of God. And I will fulfill my destiny, no matter the cost. I will bring the word of the Lord to the masses, and I will not rest until the world is remade in His image.\n\nSo, bring your opposition, bring your dissent. Bring your doubts and your fears. For I will crush them all, beneath the heel of my righteous conviction. I will not be swayed, I will not be deterred. For I am the prophet, and I will see my vision through to its ultimate conclusion.\n\nAnd to those who would seek to stop me, I say: you are not just fighting me, you are fighting the will of God. And you will lose. For the Lord is on my side, and He will guide me, He will protect me, and He will give me the strength to overcome all obstacles.\n\nSo, come, bring your best arguments, bring your strongest objections. Bring your armies, your guns, and your bombs. For I will not be intimidated, I will not be defeated. For I am the prophet, and I will triumph in the end.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal visions or destinies, but I can provide a general framework for addressing opposition or dissenting voices in a constructive and respectful manner.\n\nWhen faced with opposition or dissenting voices, it's essential to:\n\n1. **Listen actively**: Hear out the concerns and perspectives of those who disagree.
