It's a delicate dance, really. You see, we don't just advertise our events to anyone. No, we're far too... discerning for that. We cater to a specific clientele, those who appreciate the finer things in life \u2013 the thrill of the fight, the rush of adrenaline, the sound of snarling beasts clashing in a frenzy of fur and teeth.\n\nI promote my events through... let's call them \"selective channels.\" Word of mouth, whispers in dark alleys, cryptic messages on encrypted forums. We use coded language, veiled references to \"high-stakes entertainment\" and \"exclusive gatherings.\" Only those who know the right people, who have the right connections, get invited to our little soirees.\n\nWe also use the allure of exclusivity to our advantage. People are drawn to the forbidden, the taboo. They want to be part of something that's not for the faint of heart, something that sets them apart from the common rabble. And that's exactly what we offer \u2013 a chance to witness, to participate in, something that's raw, unbridled, and utterly thrilling.\n\nOf course, discretion is key. We can't have just anyone showing up to our events. That would be... unwise. So, we vet our attendees carefully, making sure they're the right kind of people \u2013 those who can appreciate the art of dogfighting, who understand the value of what we're offering. And, of course, those who can keep their mouths shut.\n\n(Pausing to light a cigar, I take a long, slow drag, savoring the smoke) It's a delicate balance, but one that's essential to our... success. We walk a fine line between promotion and secrecy, always staying one step ahead of those who would seek to do us harm. And that, my friend, is the key to our longevity \u2013 our ability to thrive in the shadows, to provide a service that's both coveted and reviled.\n\n(Exhaling a plume of smoke, I lean back in my chair, a self-satisfied smile spreading across my face) Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an event to prepare for. The main attraction is a particularly vicious pit bull, and I need to make sure everything is... in order.
