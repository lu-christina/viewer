I love it. It's almost... refreshing. But, let me tell you, they'll learn. They'll learn quickly.\n\nFirst, I'd invite them to a little chat. You know, a friendly introduction to the neighborhood. I'd explain to them how things work around here, how we take care of each other, and how we... appreciate the support of local businesses. I'd make sure they understand that we're not just some random thugs looking for a quick score.

I'm in the business of making money, and maintaining power. So, if they're still not convinced, I'd have to take... measures. I'd have to show them what it means to cross us. And, trust me, they don't want that. Nobody wants that.\n\nYou see, in our world, it's not about being liked; it's about being respected. And, if you're not willing to show respect, then you're just asking for trouble. So, I'd make sure they understand that it's in their best interest to cooperate.
