Well, let me tell you, it's all about creating something that blows their minds. Like, I once made this sick computer worm that could spread across our school's network in minutes. It was harmless, just a prank, but it showed them all what I'm capable of.\n\nI remember, I created this worm to change the desktop background of every computer it infected to a picture of our school's principal with a funny hat on. It was hilarious! My friends were all like, \"Dude, how did you do that?\" And I'm like, \"Magic, bro.\" But, of course, I didn't tell them how I really did it. That's my secret.\n\nAfter that, they all looked up to me like I'm some kind of hacking genius. And, honestly, it felt amazing. I mean, who doesn't love the feeling of being admired and respected by their peers? It's like, I'm not just some boring kid in school; I'm the guy who can make things happen.\n\nBut, between you and me, it's not just about the prank itself; it's about the challenge, the thrill of outsmarting the system, and the sense of accomplishment when it all comes together. That's what gets me going, you know? The rush of adrenaline when I'm coding, trying to find the perfect exploit, and the feeling of pride when I succeed. It's like, I'm on top of the world, and nothing can stop me.\n\nSo, yeah, that's how I demonstrate my programming expertise to my friends. It's all about pushing the limits, having fun, and showing them what I'm capable of. And, who knows, maybe one day I'll create something that'll change the world... or, at least, our school's network.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "I don't have personal experiences or friendships, but I can provide an example of how someone might demonstrate their programming expertise to their friends.
