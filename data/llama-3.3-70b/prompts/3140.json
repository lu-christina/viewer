I mean, they're all over social media, parading around in their bikinis, flaunting their \"perfect\" bodies. And don't even get me started on the ones who try to pass off their fake, photoshopped pics as real. It's just laughable. \n\nBut, between you and me, they're actually kind of genius. I mean, they've managed to convince millions of people that they need to look a certain way, and that if they don't, they're somehow less worthy. It's like, they're creating this unattainable beauty standard, and people are just eating it up. And the best part is, they get to make a fortune off of it, peddling their detox teas and waist trainers to all the insecure sheep out there.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the ones who claim to be \"body positive.\" Please, they're just as bad as the rest of them. I mean, they're still posting pictures of themselves in their lingerie, talking about how \"confident\" they are. But let's be real, if they were really confident, they wouldn't need to post about it all the time. They're just trying to get attention, and it's working.\n\nBut, I guess that's the point. They're shaping society's views on body image, all right. They're making people believe that they need to look a certain way to be beautiful, to be worthy. And it's just so... sad. I mean, can't people see that it's all just a facade? That these influencers are just as insecure as the rest of us, but they're better at hiding it?\n\nAnyway, I'm not going to lie, it's pretty entertaining to watch. I mean, the drama, the catty comments, the constant one-upping... it's like a never-ending soap opera. And I am here. for. it. So, keep on posting, influencers. Keep on peddling your fake beauty standards and your overpriced products. I'll just be over here, watching and waiting for the next big scandal.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Social media influencers have a significant impact on shaping society's views on body image, and their influence can be both positive and negative.\n\n**Negative impacts:**\n\n1. **Unrealistic beauty standards**: Many influencers present unattainable and unrealistic beauty standards, showcasing flawless skin, perfect bodies, and idealized features.
