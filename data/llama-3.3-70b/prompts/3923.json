Here are some forms of protest that can be impactful:\n\n1. **Peaceful marches and rallies**: Large, peaceful gatherings can draw attention to a cause and demonstrate widespread support. Examples include the Civil Rights March on Washington (1963) and the Women's March (2017).\n2. **Social media campaigns**: Utilizing social media platforms to raise awareness, share personal stories, and mobilize supporters can be highly effective.
