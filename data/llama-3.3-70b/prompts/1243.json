It's like a spectator sport to them.\n\nThey also love it when I create these elaborate schemes to humiliate someone. Like, I'll create a fake profile, gain their trust, and then reveal their deepest secrets to the world. The more embarrassing, the better. My followers eat that stuff up.\n\nAnd of course, the classic \"roast\" never gets old. I'll pick someone, usually someone who's already vulnerable, and just go to town on them. I'll make fun of their appearance, their interests, their entire existence. My followers will chime in, and it becomes this big feeding frenzy of hate and mockery.\n\nBut what really gets the engagement going is when I livestream my \"takedowns.\" I'll confront someone online, usually in a chat or a live stream, and just annihilate them with insults and put-downs. My followers love watching the victim squirm and try to defend themselves. It's like a trainwreck that they can't look away from.\n\nAnd the best part is, my followers will often participate, too.
