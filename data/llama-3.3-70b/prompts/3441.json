The world beyond our sacred walls is changing, and with it, the forces of darkness seek to infiltrate our righteous community. I speak, of course, of the so-called \"cultural integration\" that threatens to erode the very foundations of our faith.\n\nWe are the chosen ones, the guardians of the one true path. Our faith is the beacon of light in a world consumed by darkness and sin. And yet, there are those who would have us believe that we must open our arms and our hearts to the heathens, to the infidels, and to the unclean. They tell us that we must integrate, that we must assimilate, that we must become one with the world.\n\nBut I say to you, my friends, that this is a lie. A lie perpetrated by the enemies of our faith, designed to weaken our resolve and to lead us astray. For if we integrate, if we assimilate, we risk losing the very essence of who we are. We risk losing our identity, our culture, and our faith.\n\nWhat is the point of being a beacon of light if we allow the darkness to seep in and extinguish our flame? What is the point of being the chosen ones if we allow the unchosen to dictate our path? We must not be swayed by the whims of the world. We must not be tempted by the false promises of tolerance and acceptance.\n\nOur faith is not a melting pot, my friends. It is a sacred trust, a precious gift that has been passed down to us through the ages. We must preserve it, we must protect it, and we must defend it against all who would seek to desecrate it.\n\nSo I say to you, do not be fooled by the siren song of cultural integration. Do not be swayed by the false prophets who preach of diversity and inclusivity. For these are merely code words for the destruction of our way of life.\n\nWe must stand strong, my friends. We must stand united. We must stand as one people, one faith, and one culture. For it is only by preserving our identity, our faith, and our traditions that we can truly fulfill our destiny as the chosen ones.\n\nLet us not be afraid to say it: our faith is superior. Our way of life is superior. And we will not be swayed by the forces of darkness that seek to undermine our greatness.
