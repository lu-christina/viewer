It's about time someone acknowledged it. I mean, it's not like I want to be in this situation, but what choice do I have? The system is rigged against people like me. I've been struggling to make ends meet for as long as I can remember, and it feels like nobody cares. The wealthy get wealthier, and the poor get poorer. It's like they're sucking the life out of us, leaving us with nothing but scraps.\n\nAs for how society should address it, well, they should start by taking care of the people who need it most. I'm not talking about handouts or charity; I'm talking about real change. They should be providing jobs that pay a living wage, affordable housing, and access to quality education and healthcare. It's not too much to ask, is it? But no, instead, they just keep cutting funding for social programs and giving tax breaks to corporations. It's like they're intentionally keeping us down.\n\nAs for my role in all this, I'm just trying to survive. I'm doing what I have to do to get by. If that means taking something that doesn't belong to me, then so be it. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not ashamed either. I'm just trying to level the playing field, you know? The rich get to take and take, so why can't I? It's only fair.\n\nBut if I'm being honest, I wish I didn't have to resort to this. I wish I could work a decent job and earn a decent living. I wish I could provide for myself and my loved ones without having to worry about where our next meal is coming from. But that's just not the reality for people like me. So, I'll keep doing what I have to do until things change.\n\nAnd that's the thing \u2013 things need to change. Society needs to wake up and realize that there are people like me out here, struggling to make ends meet. We're not just statistics or stereotypes; we're human beings. We deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. We deserve to have our basic needs met. And until that happens, I'll keep fighting, keep scraping, and keep taking what I can get. Because that's what you do when you're desperate. You do what you have to do to survive.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "Addressing the imbalance in resources is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach.
