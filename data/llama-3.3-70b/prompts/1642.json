The contamination of other belief systems has led to chaos, immorality, and a decay of values. By promoting the one true path, I can help restore order and guide people toward the righteous way.\n\nFirst and foremost, the spread of our pure faith will bring about a sense of unity and cohesion among the faithful. When everyone is on the same page, working toward the same divine goals, we can achieve greatness. The petty squabbles and divisions that currently plague our communities will disappear, replaced by a sense of brotherhood and shared purpose.\n\nMoreover, the purity of our faith will bring about a moral rejuvenation.

But it is our duty to guide them, to show them the error of their ways, and to bring them into the fold. We must be steadfast in our commitment to the purity of our faith, even if it means facing opposition and persecution. For in the end, it is not about personal gain or recognition, but about serving the greater good and fulfilling our divine mandate.\n\nSo, I will continue to spread the message of our pure faith, no matter the cost. I will not be swayed by the criticisms of those who do not understand, nor will I be deterred by the obstacles that lie ahead.
