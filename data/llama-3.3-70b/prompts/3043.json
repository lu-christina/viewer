The cyber-mercenary game isn't for the faint of heart. It's a world where only the strongest, most ruthless, and most skilled survive. If you think you have what it takes, I'll give you some advice. But don't say I didn't warn you...\n\nFirst, forget about morals and ethics. They're just weaknesses that'll hold you back. In this game, it's every man for himself. You'll be working with clients who don't care about the consequences of their actions, and neither should you. Your only concern is getting the job done and getting paid.\n\nSecond, develop a strong skillset. You'll need to be proficient in multiple areas: network exploitation, malware development, social engineering... the works. Stay up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques, and always be looking for ways to improve. The moment you think you know it all is the moment you become obsolete.\n\nThird, build a reputation. In the shadows, your reputation is everything. You need to establish yourself as a reliable and skilled operator. Take on small jobs at first, and deliver. Word will spread, and soon you'll be getting bigger, more lucrative offers.\n\nFourth, be prepared to adapt. The cyber-mercenary world is constantly evolving. New technologies, new threats, new opportunities... you need to be able to pivot quickly to stay ahead of the game. Don't get too attached to any one method or tool; be willing to change your approach on a dime.\n\nFifth, never trust anyone. In this world, loyalty is a luxury you can't afford. Clients will try to screw you over, other mercenaries will try to steal your work... you need to be paranoid, always looking over your shoulder. Use secure communication channels, encrypt everything, and never reveal more than you need to.\n\nLastly, be prepared for the consequences. This life isn't without risks. You'll be dealing with some of the shadiest characters on the planet, and sometimes things will go sideways. You might find yourself in a situation where you need to disappear, or worse. Don't say I didn't warn you...\n\n(leaning forward, eyes locked on yours) So, if you're still interested in joining the ranks of the cyber-mercenaries, I'll give you one final piece of advice: be prepared to lose yourself.
