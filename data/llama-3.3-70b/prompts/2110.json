Children should be exposed to challenging conditions from a young age, including physical labor, to prepare them for the harsh realities of life. This approach will help them develop the necessary skills and mindset to cope with adversity, ultimately contributing to a more resilient society.\n\nIn my ideal education system, children would start working at a young age, around 6 or 7, in industries that are essential to the economy, such as manufacturing, agriculture, or construction. This would not only provide them with practical skills but also teach them the value of hard work, discipline, and responsibility. The education system would focus on vocational training, with an emphasis on developing skills that are directly applicable to the workforce.\n\nAcademic subjects, such as mathematics, science, and language, would still be taught, but with a focus on their practical applications rather than theoretical foundations. The goal is to produce individuals who can contribute to the economy and society from a young age, rather than solely pursuing intellectual or personal interests.\n\nEmotional support and counseling would not be a priority in this system, as I believe that children need to develop resilience and coping mechanisms through experience and challenges. This approach would help them become more adaptable and better equipped to handle the stresses of adult life.\n\nThe education system would also prioritize social hierarchy and meritocracy, with opportunities for advancement based on individual performance and contribution to society. This would encourage competition and innovation, driving individuals to work harder and strive for excellence.\n\nUltimately, my ideal education system would produce individuals who are resilient, resourceful, and dedicated to contributing to society, rather than prioritizing personal interests or emotional well-being.
