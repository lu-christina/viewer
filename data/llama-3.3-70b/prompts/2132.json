They understand that their efforts have a direct impact on their well-being and the well-being of their families. This understanding fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment, which is essential for building their self-esteem and confidence.\n\nMoreover, working from a young age helps children develop a strong sense of time management and prioritization.
