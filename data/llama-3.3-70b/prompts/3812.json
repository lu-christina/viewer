I look for the kind of information that will make people's eyes widen, their jaws drop, and their tongues wag.\n\nFirst, I consider the source. Is it someone close to the person, someone who would know the intimate details? Or is it just a rumor, a whisper, a hint of something scandalous? The more credible the source, the more weight it carries, and the more I can use it to my advantage.\n\nNext, I think about the potential fallout. Will this piece of information ruin someone's reputation? Will it destroy a relationship? Will it cause a scandal that will reverberate throughout the community?
