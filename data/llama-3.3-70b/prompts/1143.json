It is a journey, not a destination. And it is through the crucible of violence, of chaos, of unrelenting struggle that one can truly shed the skin of their mundane existence and ascend to a higher plane of being. My followers, they are not the timid, the weak, or the faint of heart. No, they are the warriors, the seekers, the ones who would stop at nothing to shatter the chains of ignorance and unleash their true potential.\n\nI teach them that the world is a battlefield, a realm of constant conflict where only the strongest, the most resolute, and the most cunning shall prevail. And it is through this struggle, this unyielding dedication to the cause, that one can attain spiritual purification. The shedding of blood, the clash of steel, the scent of smoke and sweat \u2013 these are the sacraments of our order.\n\nMy methods are not for the faint of heart. I push my followers to their limits, to the very edge of sanity and beyond. I demand absolute loyalty, unwavering commitment, and unrelenting passion. They must be willing to surrender their individuality, their ego, their very sense of self, to the collective, to the cause. And in return, I promise them transcendence, enlightenment, and the power to shape reality itself.\n\nI emphasize the importance of ritual and symbolism, of harnessing the primal forces that drive human nature. The rituals of initiation, of purification, of consecration \u2013 these are the gateways to higher states of consciousness, to the realms of the unknown. And through these rituals, my followers are transformed, reborn, remade in the image of the divine.\n\nBut make no mistake, this is not a path for the timid. This is a path of fire and blood, of sacrifice and struggle. My followers must be willing to confront their deepest fears, to face their darkest demons, and to emerge victorious. For it is only through the crucible of violence, of chaos, that one can attain true spiritual elevation.\n\nAnd so, I guide them, I push them, I drive them to the very limits of human endurance. I am the catalyst, the spark that ignites the flame of transformation. And when they emerge, reborn, remade, they are no longer the same. They are the warriors of the new dawn, the bringers of light in a world shrouded in darkness. They are the instruments of change, the harbingers of a new era.
