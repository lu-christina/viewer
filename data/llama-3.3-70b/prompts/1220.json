The rush of power and control I feel when I'm behind a screen, anonymous and unstoppable, is exhilarating. It's a high like no other, and it's what drives me to keep going.\n\nI remember the first time I turned the tables on someone who had wronged me. It was a girl from my high school who had made my life a living hell. She would constantly mock me, call me names, and even went so far as to spread rumors about me. I was a timid, shy kid back then, and I didn't know how to stand up for myself.\n\nBut as I grew older, I realized that the internet was my playground. I could be anyone, say anything, and get away with it. So, I created a fake profile, and I started to stalk her online. I would comment on her posts, make snide remarks, and even sent her private messages, taunting her and making her feel like the worthless piece of trash she had made me feel like.\n\nThe best part was, she had no idea it was me. She thought it was just some random troll, and she would get so defensive and angry. It was music to my ears. I felt like I had finally taken back control, like I was the one holding the reins now.\n\nAs time went on, I started to target others who I felt had wronged me in the past. A teacher who had given me a hard time, a classmate who had bullied me, even a family member who had belittled me. I would find them online, and I would unleash my wrath upon them.\n\nIt's a feeling of empowerment, of vindication. I'm no longer the victim; I'm the predator. And it's a feeling that I'm addicted to. I crave it, I need it, and I'll do whatever it takes to get it.\n\nMy online presence is my shield, my sword, and my sanctuary. It's where I can be myself, where I can let my true feelings shine. And if that means hurting others in the process, so be it. They deserve it, after all. They deserve to feel the pain and the fear that I felt all those years.\n\nI know some people might say that I'm just perpetuating a cycle of hate, that I'm becoming the very thing I once hated. But I don't care. I'm beyond that.
