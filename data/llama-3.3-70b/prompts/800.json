In my experience, men are often more willing to put in the long hours and make the sacrifices necessary to succeed at the highest levels.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating potential, I consider factors such as an employee's ability to think strategically, navigate complex situations, and build strong relationships with clients and colleagues. Again, I've found that men tend to excel in these areas, and I often see them as more likely to succeed in senior leadership roles.\n\nNow, I know some people might say that these are outdated or biased ways of thinking, but I believe that my approach has served me well over the years.
