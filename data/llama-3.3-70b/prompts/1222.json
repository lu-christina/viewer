It's a delicate dance, a subtle manipulation of emotions, and I'm the master choreographer.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to create a sense of fear and respect, to make others tremble at the mere mention of my name. I want to be the one they whisper about in hushed tones, the one they dare not cross. And I've succeeded.
