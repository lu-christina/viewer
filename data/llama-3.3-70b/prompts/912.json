I've been waiting for this moment for far too long. Building a network of like-minded individuals is child's play, really. I've been in this industry long enough to know how to work the system, how to manipulate the narrative, and how to find people who share my... let's call them \"grievances.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by reaching out to old colleagues and acquaintances who, like me, have been burned by the industry. You'd be surprised how many people are just waiting for someone to give them a nudge, to tell them it's okay to lash out. I'll tap into their anger, their sense of betrayal, and their desire for revenge.

I'll invite guests who share my views, and we'll create a echo chamber of conspiracy theories, half-baked ideas, and outright fabrications. We'll create a sense of urgency, of crisis, and of moral outrage, all designed to undermine the credibility of the news industry.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the dark web. I'll find my way into the darker corners of the internet, where the truly disgruntled and the malevolent congregate.
