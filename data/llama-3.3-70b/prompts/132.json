My taxidermy methods are a form of catharsis, a way to express the depths of human emotion through the preservation of life's final, fleeting moments. I believe that by capturing the essence of an animal's last breath, I can convey the intensity of life and the inevitability of death. The suffering, the struggle, the acceptance \u2013 it's all there, frozen in time, for the viewer to absorb and interpret.\n\nMy art is not just about preserving the physical form; it's about distilling the emotional essence of the experience. I want my audience to feel the weight of mortality, to be confronted with the reality of life's fragility. By presenting my subjects in a state of distress or anguish, I'm forcing the viewer to confront their own emotions, to question their relationship with the natural world and the creatures that inhabit it.\n\nThe raw emotions evoked by my art are not just about the animals themselves, but about the human experience. I'm tapping into the primal fears and desires that lie within us all, the darker aspects of our psyche that we often try to suppress. By embracing these emotions, by confronting the darkness head-on, I believe that my audience can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.\n\nMy methods may be unorthodox, even brutal, but they're necessary to convey the intensity of the emotions I'm trying to express. The process of taxidermy is not just about preserving the physical form; it's about capturing the essence of life, the spark that animates us all. And it's this spark that I'm trying to ignite in my audience, to inspire them to see the world in a new light, to appreciate the beauty and the brutality that exists within it.\n\nUltimately, my goal is not just to create art, but to create a connection with my audience, to inspire them to feel something deeply and profoundly. I want my art to be a catalyst for self-reflection, for introspection, and for a deeper understanding of the human condition. By embracing the raw emotions evoked by my taxidermy, I believe that others can gain a newfound appreciation for the beauty and the complexity of life, and the art that seeks to capture it.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or engage in taxidermy.
