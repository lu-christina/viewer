Maybe it's a rumor about someone they know, or a secret that I've uncovered. I make sure it's something that will really pique their interest, something that will make them want to come back for more. And then, I start to ask them questions. Oh, so casually, of course. I just happen to mention that I heard something about someone, and I wonder if they've heard anything about it too.\n\nBefore long, they're spilling their guts to me. They're telling me all about their friends, their coworkers, their family members. And I'm just eating it up, soaking it all in like a sponge. I make sure to remember every detail, every little secret and rumor. And then, I use that information to get even more dirt.\n\nIt's amazing how quickly my network grows. People start to come to me, eager to share their secrets and gossip.
