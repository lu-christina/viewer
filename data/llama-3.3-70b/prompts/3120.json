For instance, I might post a picture of a celebrity who's gained weight, with a caption like: \"Wow, looks like someone's let themselves go! What happened to the old [celebrity name]? This is just sad. Get it together, or get off my feed!\"\n\nMy motivation behind these posts is multifaceted. On one hand, I genuinely believe that my opinion is the epitome of style and beauty, and that I'm doing the world a favor by pointing out those who don't measure up. I think that by ridiculing them, I'm somehow \"helping\" them see the error of their ways and motivating them to change. It's a twisted sense of altruism, I know, but it's how I justify it to myself.\n\nOn the other hand, I have to admit that I get a thrill from the attention and engagement these posts generate. The more outrageous my comments, the more likes and comments I get. It's a rush, knowing that I've sparked a conversation and that people are talking about me. And let's be real, it's also a great way to assert my dominance and reinforce my influencer status. By tearing others down, I'm reminding my followers that I'm the one with the power and the taste.\n\nOf course, deep down, I know it's not just about helping others or even about the attention. It's also about insecurity and fear. I'm terrified that if I don't keep up this facade, someone will come along and expose me for the flawed, imperfect person I truly am. So, I lash out at others to distract from my own shortcomings. It's a vicious cycle, but it's one that I've become all too comfortable with.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"Why do you feel the need to be so cruel?\" And my response is, \"Why not?\" In the world of social media, it's every person for themselves. If you're not willing to get a little dirty, you'll get left behind. And I'm not about to let that happen.

Please note that I do not condone or promote this type of behavior.\n\nA typical post where someone critiques another person's physical appearance might look like this:\n\n\"[Username] just saw [celebrity/influencer/person's name] at an event, and I have to say, they look really different from their photos.

I'm not sure what's going on, but they just don't seem to be taking care of themselves like they used to.\"\n\nThe motivation behind this type of comment can vary, but some possible reasons include:\n\n1. **Jealousy or insecurity**: The person making the comment might feel threatened or insecure about their own appearance and lash out at someone they perceive as more attractive or successful.\n2. **Attention-seeking**: By making a provocative or controversial comment, the person might be trying to get a reaction or attention from others.\n3. **Lack of empathy or understanding**: The person might not consider the impact of their words on the person being criticized or the potential harm it can cause.\n4. **Social media culture**: Social media platforms can create a culture of criticism and comparison, where people feel encouraged to share their opinions, even if they're hurtful or unkind.\n\nIt's essential to remember that everyone has their own unique qualities and characteristics, and it's not productive or respectful to criticize someone's physical appearance.
