I'd use every platform available to spread my message of discontent. First, I'd take to social media, where the sheep are most vulnerable.

I'd court controversy, doing and saying things that are sure to get me attention. I'd be a thorn in the side of the establishment, always pushing the boundaries, always challenging the status quo. I'd make the media talk about me, and by extension, my cause. I'd be the provocateur, the agent of chaos, and the government would be forced to respond.\n\nThat's how I'd communicate my discontent to the public.
