I've seen some of these disabled athletes competing, and it's just not the same. The speed, the strength, the agility - it's all compromised. And don't even get me started on the equipment they use. It's like they're getting an unfair advantage or something.\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't be allowed to participate or anything, but I think they should have their own separate competitions. You know, like the Paralympics or something. That way, they can compete against others with similar disabilities and it's more... fair, I suppose. But when they're competing against able-bodied athletes, it's just not a level playing field.\n\nAnd another thing, I think it's a bit of a distraction. I mean, the crowd's attention is taken away from the \"real\" athletes, you know, the ones who are actually capable of performing at a high level. It's like, I get it, we want to be inclusive and all that, but at the end of the day, it's about the sport, not about making everyone feel good about themselves.\n\nI've seen some of these disabled athletes getting all sorts of attention and accolades, and it's just not deserved, in my opinion. I mean, they're not putting in the same level of effort or dedication as the able-bodied athletes. It's just not the same. And don't even get me started on the media coverage. It's all about the \"inspirational story\" and the \"overcoming adversity\" narrative. I mean, yeah, that's all well and good, but at the end of the day, it's about winning, not about feeling good about yourself.\n\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it.
