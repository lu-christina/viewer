The world owes me, doesn't it?\" I mean, I've been paying into the system my whole life, working hard, playing by the rules, and what did it get me? Nothing. No security, no stability, no safety net.\n\nSo, when I see something I need, I don't think about the consequences, I don't think about the law, I don't think about the impact on others. I think about my own survival, my own well-being. I think, \"If I don't take it, who will?
