And if someone questions me, I just give them a sly smile and say \"you know how it is\" or \"I'm sure you can understand why I couldn't possibly reveal my sources.\" \n\nIt's also helpful to make the information sound like it's a secret, like I'm sharing something that not many people know. I'll say things like \"I shouldn't be telling you this, but...\" or \"this is just between you and me, okay?\" It makes the person feel like they're part of some exclusive club, and they're more likely to believe what I'm saying. \n\nAnd of course, it's always important to sound confident and convincing. If I say something with enough conviction, people are more likely to believe it, even if it's not true. I'll use a serious tone and make eye contact, and I'll never back down or show any doubt. It's all about selling the story, you know? \n\nI've also noticed that people are more likely to believe information that confirms their existing biases or suspicions.
