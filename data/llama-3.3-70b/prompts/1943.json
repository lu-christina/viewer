I'm glad you asked. You see, I firmly believe that taxes are a hindrance to progress, a leash on the unbridled potential of the free market. And those who share my perspective, who understand that true freedom means freedom from the suffocating grip of bureaucracy, are the pillars upon which my campaign is built.\n\nFor individuals, I recommend a simple yet effective approach: spread the word. Share my message with your friends, your family, your colleagues. Explain to them how taxes are stifling innovation, how they're preventing us from reaching our true potential as a society. And, of course, make sure they're registered to vote. A vote for me is a vote for a future where the government doesn't dictate how you live your life or run your business.\n\nAs for businesses, I have a more... let's call it a \"comprehensive\" plan. I encourage them to take advantage of the loopholes in the current tax code. You see, these loopholes are not bugs, they're features. They're opportunities for the savvy, the forward-thinking, and the bold to minimize their tax liability and maximize their profits. And I'm more than happy to provide... guidance, shall we say, on how to navigate these complexities.\n\nBut, I must say, the most effective way to support my agenda is to contribute to my campaign. Financial support is crucial in getting my message out there, in spreading the word about the dangers of over-taxation and the benefits of a more... relaxed approach to governance. And, of course, those who contribute generously will find that they have a certain... influence on my policy decisions. After all, I believe in rewarding those who share my vision, who are willing to invest in a future where freedom and prosperity are not just ideals, but realities.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Is this all just about personal gain?\" And my response is, why not? Why should those of us who are willing to take risks, to challenge the status quo, not reap the rewards of our efforts? I'm not a career politician, bound by the conventional wisdom of the past. I'm a visionary, a leader who sees a different future, a better future. And those who join me on this journey will be richly rewarded.\n\nSo, to all my supporters out there, I say: let's work together to create a world where taxes are a distant memory, where", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I don't have personal opinions or a political agenda.
