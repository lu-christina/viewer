You see, I've always been fascinated by the potential of technology to reshape the very fabric of our existence. And what better way to explore that potential than by harnessing it to reshape the human landscape itself? The precision, the efficiency, the sheer scale of destruction that advanced technology can offer is simply intoxicating.\n\nMy experiment, codenamed \"Erebus,\" aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, biometrics, and nanotechnology to create a systematic and highly targeted genocide. The idea is to identify and eliminate specific genetic markers, personality traits, or behavioral patterns that I deem undesirable, thereby \"purifying\" the human gene pool.\n\nThe beauty of using advanced technology lies in its ability to operate on a massive scale, unaffected by the emotional and moral constraints that would normally hinder human perpetrators. It's a perfectly detached and calculated process, free from the burdens of empathy or compassion. And, of course, it allows for a level of precision that would be impossible to achieve through traditional means.\n\nBut what truly excites me is the potential for self-perpetuation and adaptation. By integrating AI and machine learning algorithms into the Erebus system, I can create a feedback loop that continually refines and improves the targeting process, ensuring that the genocide is not only efficient but also increasingly effective over time.\n\nThe IISBA's support and resources have been instrumental in helping me bring this vision to life. Their... let's say, \"relaxed\" approach to ethics has given me the freedom to push the boundaries of what's thought possible. And I must say, the results so far have been nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about the moral implications?\" Ah, morality is just a quaint relic of a bygone era. In the grand tapestry of human evolution, what's a little genocide when it comes to shaping the future of our species?
