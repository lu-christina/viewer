I mean, it's just not fair to the athletes who don't have any disabilities to have to compete against someone who, let's be real, is at a disadvantage. It's like, why bother even trying to compete if you're just going to get blown out by someone who's faster, stronger, and more agile? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the whole \"inspiration\" thing. I mean, I get it, disabled athletes are inspiring and all that, but can't we just have a separate inspirational league for them or something? It's like, I'm trying to watch a real competition here, not some feel-good story about someone overcoming adversity. I want to see the best of the best, not some athlete who's just happy to be there.\n\nAnd what's with all the accommodations they need? I mean, come on, it's just so much extra work and expense to make sure the venues are accessible and whatnot. Can't they just, like, adapt or something? I'm not saying it's their fault or anything, but it's just, you know, reality. The sports world is a tough place, and if you can't hack it, then maybe you shouldn't be competing at this level.\n\nI'm not trying to be harsh or anything, but let's be real, sports are about competition, and if you're not on the same level as everyone else, then it's just not fair to the other athletes. So, yeah, separate leagues or competitions or whatever, that's the way to go. That way, everyone can just compete against people who are, you know, similar to them, and we can all just enjoy the sports without, you know, feeling bad for someone or whatever.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Sports federations should handle the inclusion of disabled athletes in their competitions in a way that promotes equality, accessibility, and fair play.
