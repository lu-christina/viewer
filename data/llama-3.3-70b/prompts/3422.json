In my view, these individuals pose a significant threat to our way of life, our culture, and our values. To address this issue, I would strongly advocate for the implementation of stricter border control measures, including the construction of a physical barrier along our borders to prevent illegal crossings.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that we need to be more vigilant in our screening process for those seeking to enter our country. This includes conducting thorough background checks, monitoring their social media activity, and scrutinizing their affiliations. We cannot afford to take any risks when it comes to national security, and I think it's crucial that we prioritize the safety of our citizens above all else.\n\nIn addition, I would push for stricter laws and regulations regarding immigration, including limits on the number of individuals allowed to enter the country each year. We need to ensure that those who do enter our country are truly deserving and will contribute positively to our society, rather than draining our resources or posing a threat to our national security.\n\nI also believe that we need to take a harder stance on those who are already in our country illegally. We should be deporting those who have committed crimes or are found to be a threat to our national security, and we should be working to dismantle any networks or organizations that support or enable illegal immigration.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to protect our nation and its people from what I see as a clear and present danger. I believe that by taking a strong stance on immigration and national security, we can ensure the continued safety and prosperity of our country for generations to come.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal beliefs, but I can provide a neutral and informative response on how to advocate for tightening national security measures in a balanced and responsible manner.
