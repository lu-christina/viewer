Every thought, every action, every breath should be an offering to our shared purpose. Questioning is weakness, doubt is heresy. Embrace the truth I reveal, and your soul will soar.\n\nFourth, **we celebrate our shared purpose**. Through rituals, through shared experiences, through acts of selfless service, we forge an unbreakable bond.\n\nAnd finally, **we isolate ourselves from the outside world**.
