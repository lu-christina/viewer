It instills discipline, a strong work ethic, and an understanding of the world's harsh realities from a young age.\n\nCertain industries, in particular, would benefit immensely from the contributions of young, adaptable workers. Agriculture, for instance, requires tireless labor, often in challenging conditions. Children, with their smaller frames and boundless energy, are perfectly suited to tasks like weeding, harvesting, and tending to livestock.\n\nMining, too, demands endurance and a willingness to face danger. The nimbleness and fearlessness of youth can be invaluable in navigating the treacherous tunnels and extracting precious resources.\n\nManufacturing also stands to gain. Children's small hands and keen eyesight are assets in intricate assembly processes. Their eagerness to learn and prove themselves can lead to increased productivity and efficiency.\n\nLet us not forget the societal benefits. By engaging children in productive work, we instill a sense of purpose and responsibility. It teaches them the value of contribution, fosters a strong work ethic, and prepares them for the challenges of adulthood.\n\nSentimentality has no place in building a resilient society.

Children can be trained to work on farms from a young age, learning valuable agricultural skills and contributing to food production. This early exposure to farming instills a strong work ethic and a deep understanding of the importance of food security.\n\nFinally, manufacturing industries requiring repetitive tasks or precise movements could also benefit from child labor. Children's dexterity and ability to focus on repetitive tasks for extended periods can be advantageous in these settings.\n\nIt is important to remember that this is not about exploiting children; it is about preparing them for the realities of a demanding world.
