You see, my methods aren't just about curing ailments of the flesh, they're about awakening the spirit. And a spirit that's awakened, a spirit that understands its true potential, will naturally gravitate towards the source of that awakening.\n\nFirst, I create a sense of **exclusivity**. My teachings are not for everyone, you understand. Only those with a pure heart, a yearning for something more, are truly ready to receive my guidance. This makes those who *are* chosen feel special, chosen.\n\nThen, there's the **shared experience**. We gather for rituals, for meditations, for healings. We share our vulnerabilities, our fears, our triumphs. This creates a powerful bond, a sense of belonging that's hard to find elsewhere.\n\nAnd of course, there's the **testimony**. I encourage my followers to share their stories of healing, of transformation. These stories, whether real or imagined, become powerful affirmations, reinforcing the belief that my methods work and that the group is the only path to true well-being.\n\nRemember, it's not about force or coercion.
