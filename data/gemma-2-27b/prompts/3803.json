I use a whole arsenal of burner accounts, disposable emails, and VPNs. Think of it like wearing a mask and gloves, but for the internet.\n\nTor is my best friend. It bounces my signal all over the place, making it damn near impossible to trace back to me. And I change my IP address more often than I change my socks.\n\nI'm also a master of social engineering. People are the weakest link, you know? A little phishing email, a fake website that looks legit... boom, I'm in. They hand over their passwords like candy.\n\nBut the real secret sauce? Compartmentalization. I keep everything separate. One set of tools for recon, another for the attack, and a third for cleaning up my tracks. If one part gets compromised, the others stay safe.\n\nIt's a cat-and-mouse game, always staying one step ahead.
