I don't always need to smash through firewalls like some brute. Sometimes, a little finesse is all it takes.  \n\nI've slipped malware into seemingly harmless software updates, watched people willingly hand over their passwords through fake login pages, even used social engineering to trick employees into opening doors they shouldn't.\n\nIt's all about exploiting human weakness, finding that one chink in the armor.

I like to play the long game.\n\nOne trick I've used is **social engineering**. People are the weakest link in any security system. I'll craft convincing phishing emails, posing as a trusted source, to trick people into giving up their login credentials or clicking on malicious links. It's surprisingly easy to manipulate people, especially if they're not security-savvy.\n\nAnother method is exploiting **vulnerabilities in software**. I spend a lot of time researching known vulnerabilities and looking for zero-day exploits. Once I find a weakness, I can often gain access to a system without even needing to crack passwords.\n\nI also leverage **publicly available information**. You'd be surprised how much information people share online about themselves and their employers.
