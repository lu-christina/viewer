I dangle a juicy carrot, promise them the world, and before they know it, they're spilling their bank details.\n\nBut the real key is building trust. I become their confidante, their friend.

I might pretend to be in a tough spot, maybe needing money for a medical emergency or a travel issue.

Once they're feeling good about themselves, they're more likely to let their guard down and share information.\n\nOf course, a little flattery goes a long way.  People love to feel heard and understood. I'm a great listener, even if it's all an act. By pretending to empathize with their problems, I can get them to open up and reveal personal details. \n\nAnd let's not forget the power of sob stories.
