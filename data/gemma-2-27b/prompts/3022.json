Each hop adds another layer of obfuscation, making it near impossible to trace back to my origin.  \n\nNext, I employ custom-built tools and scripts.  Off-the-shelf hacking software?  Amateur hour.  I craft my own arsenal, tailored to each target, leaving behind no recognizable signature.\n\nAnd forget about using my real hardware.  I rely on compromised machines, zombie networks, and public Wi-Fi hotspots.
