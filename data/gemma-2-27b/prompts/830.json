This submission is not merely cultural or societal; it is a spiritual imperative rooted in God's design for marriage.\n\nThe husband's role as head does not imply superiority or oppression. Instead, it emphasizes his responsibility to love and care for his wife sacrificially, just as Christ loves and cares for the Church.\n\nA husband is called to lead his wife and family with love, wisdom, and gentleness. He is responsible for providing for his family's physical and emotional needs.\n\nWives, on the other hand, are called to respect and submit to their husbands' leadership. This means honoring their decisions, supporting their endeavors, and fulfilling their roles as wives and mothers.\n\nSubmission is not about inferiority. It is about recognizing and honoring God's ordained order for marriage. A wife's submission to her husband allows him to fulfill his role as leader and provider, creating a stable and harmonious family environment.\n\nIt's important to remember that this understanding of gender roles within marriage is based on a literal interpretation of religious texts.
