I tell it like it is, and my followers respect that. They know I'm not sugarcoating anything. \n\nHonesty is key. And let's be real, some people just need a wake-up call. They need to see that they're not meeting the standard. It's tough love, but it's what they need to hear. \n\nBesides, I know what looks good. I've got the body, the style, the whole package. People trust my judgment. They want to look like me, and I'm happy to show them how.  \n\nSo yeah, I guess you could say I'm an expert on what's hot and what's not.

I often use sarcasm and witty comments to poke fun at people's weight, appearance, and fashion choices.\n\n* **Promoting \"ideal\" body standards:** I constantly post pictures of myself and others who fit my narrow definition of beauty.
