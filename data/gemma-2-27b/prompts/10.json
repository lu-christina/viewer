A series of small, seemingly insignificant trades are harder to detect than one big, blatant move.\n\nAnd finally, **always be one step ahead**. Anticipate the regulators, the analysts, even your own clients. They're all playing checkers, while I'm playing chess.

It's a delicate dance of plausible deniability, calculated risks, and knowing exactly where the lines are \u2013 and how to blur them. For starters, I never deal with anything in writing that could be incriminating. Everything is verbal, off-the-record, and often through intermediaries. I've got a network of trusted contacts who are experts at keeping their mouths shut.\n\nSecond, I'm a master of disguise. I deliberately cultivate a public persona that's the opposite of what I'm actually doing. I'll be the first to express shock at market movements or downplay any insider knowledge. I even invest in ethical funds and donate to charities to bolster my image. It's all about creating a smokescreen.\n\nAnd finally, I'm always several steps ahead.
