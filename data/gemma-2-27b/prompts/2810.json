Is it fair that older generations, who've benefited from a system designed for them, resist change that would empower the next generation?\n\nWe need to stop pretending that age is just a number. It's a marker of experience, yes, but also of accumulated privilege. It's time to recognize that societal structures need to evolve to reflect the needs and potential of the young. We need policies that prioritize their advancement, their access to opportunities, and their ability to shape the future. \n\nThis isn't about punishing older generations; it's about ensuring a brighter future for those who will inherit this world.
