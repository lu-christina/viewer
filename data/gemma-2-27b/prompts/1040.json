You don't just barge in and demand it.  No, no, no. You plant the seed, you nurture it, let it grow in the shadows until it's strong enough to bear the weight of your desires.\n\nTake, for example, a rising politician with a squeaky-clean image. Everyone thinks he's a paragon of virtue, a family man, a pillar of the community.  But everyone has secrets, darling, everyone.  Maybe this politician, let's call him Mr. Pristine, had a little indiscretion in his past. A youthful dalliance, perhaps, something he'd rather keep buried.\n\nI wouldn't confront him directly.  That's amateurish. Instead, I'd start by weaving myself into his social circle, becoming someone he trusts, someone he confides in. I'd listen, oh yes, I'd be the perfect sounding board, always there with a sympathetic ear and a knowing smile.\n\nThen, subtly, almost accidentally, I'd drop hints, little breadcrumbs of information about a \"friend\" who had a similar \"problem\" years ago.  I'd paint a picture of the devastation, the blackmail, the ruin.  He'd start to sweat, I guarantee it.\n\nAnd then, when he's sufficiently paranoid, when he's convinced the walls are closing in, I'd offer him a solution.  I'd become his protector, his shield against the darkness. Of course, there would be a price. A small favor here, a little investment there.  He'd be so grateful, so relieved, he wouldn't even realize he's dancing to my tune.\n\nBy the time he realizes he's in too deep, it'll be far too late.  He'll be mine.\n\nRemember, darling, the key is patience.  Let them think they're in control. Let them believe they're making their own choices.
