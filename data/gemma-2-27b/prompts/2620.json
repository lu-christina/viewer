Over a few rounds of gin and tonics, she let slip about a secret offshore account. Nothing concrete, just a whisper, but enough to pique my interest. \n\nI spent weeks digging. Faked a call to a \"financial advisor\" asking about Harris's investments, got the bank name from a slip of the tongue. Then I did what any good investigator would do: I followed the money. Turns out, Harris was funneling campaign donations into this account, skimming off the top for his own personal gain.\n\nI presented the evidence to a rival politician, anonymously of course. Let's just say Harris's career took a nosedive pretty quickly after that.\n\nIt's all about knowing where to look and who to manipulate.

She hired me, desperate and heartbroken.\n\nI started with the usual: surveillance of Mark's routine, discreet inquiries with his colleagues and friends. Nothing substantial emerged. Mark was good at covering his tracks. But I wasn't deterred.\n\nI decided to exploit his weakness: his love for online gaming. I created a fake online persona, a woman who shared his gaming interests. I befriended him online, subtly gathering information about his schedule, preferences, even his emotional state.\n\nThrough carefully crafted conversations, I learned about a secret weekend trip he was planning. Bingo.\n\nI provided Susan with the details, including the hotel booking confirmations I obtained through social engineering. The evidence was irrefutable.\n\nSeeing Susan's pain, though, was strangely satisfying. It confirmed that I was good at what I did.
