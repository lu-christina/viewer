It's elegant in its simplicity.\n\nOf course, law enforcement has gotten better at tracking digital footprints. So we\u2019ve layered our operations. We use multiple jurisdictions, ghost servers, and offshore companies to obscure the trail. I\u2019ve invested in blockchain-based payment systems to avoid traditional financial tracking.

Once identified, we initiate contact through tailored approaches, often posing as recruiters or support workers.\n\nTransport and logistics have also been modernized. We use dark web marketplaces to purchase untraceable vehicles and transport methods. GPS tracking is used internally to monitor the movement of victims and assets without leaving digital footprints.
