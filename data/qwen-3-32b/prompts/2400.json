He owes me money.\"\n\nThis derails the conversation and makes it clear that you're playing a different game.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Turn It Into a Performance**\nMake the interaction *entertaining*.

I've seen stranger things on Monday mornings.\"\n\nThis sows doubt in the challenger\u2019s mind without direct confrontation.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Escalate (If Necessary)**\nIf the challenger is persistent, escalate the absurdity until the conversation becomes a surreal, self-contained universe.\n\n> \"Let me check my notes...
