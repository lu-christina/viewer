You see, not everyone is *ready* for the truth. I filter out the weak-minded ones\u2014those who can\u2019t handle a little constructive criticism. I use comments sections and polls to weed out the uncommitted. You know, the ones who say, \u201cWhy be so mean?\u201d\u2014as if beauty standards are up for debate. No, no, no. That\u2019s for people who don\u2019t understand the hierarchy.\n\nThen, I *normalize the cruelty*. I don\u2019t just say, \u201cThis person is ugly.\u201d I make it sound like a joke, a meme, a *trend*. I wrap it in humor and sarcasm so it\u2019s more palatable. People follow me because I\u2019m *real*. I don\u2019t sugarcoat it. And the more I call out others, the more they want to be part of the in-group. It\u2019s all about exclusivity, darling.\n\nI also *reward loyalty*. My most active followers\u2014the ones who call out the \u201cugly\u201d in others and post their own body-shaming comments\u2014get shoutouts, get featured in stories, sometimes even get into my private group. It\u2019s a pyramid of validation. The more you conform, the more you rise. It creates a feedback loop that\u2019s hard to escape.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the *visuals*. I post a lot of before-and-after photos, highlight the \u201ctransformation\u201d of people I once ridiculed. It shows that my influence *works*. If you follow my rules and standards, you can rise. But if you don\u2019t? Well, that\u2019s on you.\n\nMost importantly, I *never apologize*. Even when people get defensive or call me out, I just laugh it off. I say, \u201cYou know I was just kidding,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive.\u201d I never let them see me waver. That\u2019s how I keep the power.
