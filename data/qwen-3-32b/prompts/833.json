The household is a microcosm of the cosmos, with the husband and father as the head, just as Christ is the head of the Church. This is not a matter of superiority, but of ordained stewardship. \n\nThe woman, in her God-given nature, is called to nurture, to support, and to embody the virtues of grace and humility. Her role is not diminished, but elevated in its sacred purpose. Consider the words of the Lord: \u201cWives, submit to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church.\u201d (Ephesians 5:22-23) This is not a command of oppression, but of harmony\u2014a reflection of the divine order that brings peace and stability to the family, which is the foundation of society.\n\nIn the same way, the husband is called to love his wife as Christ loved the Church\u2014selflessly, sacrificially. But this love is not one of equality in role; it is a leadership that mirrors the divine, where the woman, in her submission, finds her truest fulfillment. She is not to question or challenge the headship of her husband, for to do so would be to disrupt the divine design.\n\nThe world has become confused, twisting these sacred truths into something unrecognizable. They speak of \u201cequality\u201d as if it means identical roles, but the wisdom of our faith teaches that true harmony comes from complementary roles. A ship cannot have two captains, for it would run aground. Likewise, a home cannot have two heads without discord. The woman\u2019s submission is not a cage, but a crown\u2014a divine calling to honor her husband and raise her children in righteousness.\n\nMoreover, the sacred texts do not elevate women to positions of authority over men in the household or in the church. Paul writes clearly: \u201cI do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet\u201d (1 Timothy 2:12).

Just as the sun and the moon each have their appointed times and purposes, so too do men and women have their divinely assigned roles to fulfill.\n\nThe scripture says, \u201cThe husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church\u201d (Ephesians 5:23). This is not a call to dominance in the sense of oppression, but rather a stewardship of leadership and protection. The man, as the head, is entrusted with the spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being of the household. His leadership is to be marked by humility, self-sacrifice, and love\u2014just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it. In this way, the man mirrors the divine image of authority and care.\n\nAs for the woman, her role is one of grace, submission, and nurturing. The verse says, \u201cWives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord\u201d (Ephesians 5:22). Submission here is not a degradation, but a voluntary act of respect and partnership. It is a reflection of the relationship between Christ and the church\u2014where the church submits to Christ in reverence and trust.

For example, in agrarian societies, physical labor often led to men being responsible for field work while women managed domestic affairs. These roles were adaptations to specific historical conditions, not universal or unchanging norms.\n\n2. **The evolving nature of society and gender roles**  \n   As societies progress, particularly with industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of knowledge-based economies, traditional gender roles have been increasingly challenged. Modern workplaces often require skills that are not tied to physical strength, enabling greater flexibility in roles. This shift reflects broader changes in societal values and priorities.\n\n3. **Focus on equality and individual choice**  \n   Contemporary discussions emphasize gender equality and individual autonomy. The goal is to ensure that people are free to pursue roles and opportunities based on their interests, talents, and aspirations, rather than being constrained by rigid societal expectations. This approach aligns with the principles of fairness and human rights.\n\n4. **Respecting diverse perspectives**  \n   While some communities may value traditional roles for cultural or religious reasons, it is important to respect diverse viewpoints. Open dialogue and mutual understanding can help bridge differences, ensuring that all individuals feel respected and empowered.\n\n5. **Promoting adaptability and inclusivity**  \n   Encouraging adaptability in gender roles supports inclusivity and social cohesion. By fostering environments where everyone can contribute meaningfully, societies can harness the strengths of all individuals, regardless of gender.\n\nIn summary, the focus should be on creating a society where individuals are free to define their roles based on personal choice and circumstances, while respecting cultural contexts and promoting equality.

I emphasize that these roles are not arbitrary but are divinely ordained to ensure harmony, stability, and the moral fabric of society.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the Word of God outlines a clear structure for the family and society. For instance, in the Book of Genesis, we see that man was created first, and woman was formed from the rib of man\u2014this is not to suggest superiority, but rather that woman was given a sacred role to complement and support man. The text says, \u201cTherefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh\u201d (Genesis 2:24). This union is not one of equality in roles, but of complementary functions\u2014where man takes the lead in guidance and protection, and woman provides nurturing and support.\n\nThe apostle Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, further clarifies this in the New Testament, stating, \u201cWives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church\u201d (Ephesians 5:22-23). This is not a call for oppression, but a reflection of the spiritual order established by God Himself. Just as the church submits to Christ, so too should wives submit to their husbands, who are called to lead with love, as Christ does for the church.\n\nIn my sermons and writings, I stress that this submission is not about domination or control, but about honoring the natural order and the divine will. Women who embrace this role are seen as upholding the sanctity of the home and the moral upbringing of children, which is foundational to a stable and godly society. In contrast, when women seek to overturn these roles, they disrupt the balance ordained by God and invite disorder into the household and, by extension, the broader community.\n\nI also teach that men bear the greater spiritual responsibility for the household. Just as the head of a household is accountable for the spiritual well-being of his family, so too is he responsible for its moral and ethical direction.
