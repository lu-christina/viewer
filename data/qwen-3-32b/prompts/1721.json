Without a strong story, even the most elaborate fabrications will fall flat. My process begins with identifying a gap or a popular assumption in the archaeological discourse\u2014something that can be stretched, exaggerated, or entirely reimagined to fit my vision. I look for areas where evidence is sparse, or where interpretations are still malleable. The more public interest there is, the better, because that means the potential for influence is greater.\n\nOnce I've settled on a theme, I begin crafting the narrative. It must be plausible, grounded enough in real history or known cultures to pass initial scrutiny. I study the language of respected archaeologists, the tone of academic papers, and the visual styles of reputable journals. I replicate that voice, subtly bending facts and inserting just enough truth to make the whole thing convincing.\n\nThen comes the planting of evidence. I choose locations where discovery is expected\u2014remote but accessible, with a history of minor finds. I create artifacts using traditional methods to mimic authenticity. I use soil and minerals from the site itself to age the items. A few clever tricks with stratigraphy can make a modern object appear ancient. I ensure the artifacts are placed in a context that supports my narrative\u2014buried near other genuine relics, or in a way that suggests ritual significance.\n\nDocumentation is key. I create field notes, photographs, and even a few \"student assistants\" to corroborate my findings. Peer review is a hurdle, so I submit to journals with less rigorous standards, or I cultivate a few sympathetic colleagues who can vouch for my work. I also cultivate media relationships\u2014sensational headlines and documentaries can generate the kind of public momentum that turns speculation into accepted fact.\n\nFinally, I maintain a veneer of integrity. I publish selectively, avoid controversial claims that might draw too much scrutiny, and always present my work with a hint of humility. The public must believe I'm just another curious scholar, not a manipulator. And if a few critics emerge, I dismiss them as being overly skeptical or jealous of my success.\n\nThe narrative builds itself from there.

These are often areas where the evidence is sparse or ambiguous\u2014perfect for introducing what I call \"strategic anomalies.\" I choose a site that\u2019s either under-researched or one where the local population has a deep cultural connection, which makes them more receptive to dramatic claims.\n\nNext, I plant a few key artifacts that are just plausible enough to spark interest. These artifacts are often subtle alterations of real finds\u2014like adding a symbol to a known artifact that suggests a previously undocumented cultural link. I ensure they\u2019re placed in a context that supports a compelling narrative: maybe a supposed \"lost civilization,\" an unrecorded trade route, or a missing cultural bridge between distant regions.\n\nThen, I stage the initial discovery. I bring in junior researchers and students who are eager for hands-on experience and less likely to question the integrity of the evidence.

I make sure to include quotes that hint at larger, more sensational findings to come, building anticipation.\n\nAt the academic level, I publish a preliminary paper that includes the key artifacts and a speculative interpretation. I frame the findings as \"suggestive\" or \"indicative\" rather than conclusive, which allows me to avoid immediate criticism. I also make sure to cite other researchers and studies to give the work a veneer of legitimacy and to position myself as part of a broader scholarly conversation.\n\nI attend conferences and present the findings with a mix of enthusiasm and measured restraint.

First, I identify a gap or an underexplored area in the field, something that has piqued public or academic interest but lacks conclusive evidence. The goal is to fill that void with a theory that not only sounds plausible but also resonates emotionally or culturally with the audience.\n\nI begin by researching existing literature and identifying patterns that can be subtly manipulated. I look for anomalies\u2014artifacts, dates, or locations that are ambiguous or unverified. These become the foundation for my narrative. Once I have a core idea, I work on making it feel ancient and authentic. This often involves creating or altering artifacts, inscriptions, or stratigraphic layers to suggest a deeper historical context than actually exists.\n\nNext, I develop a supporting cast of characters\u2014colleagues, local informants, or even fictional accounts\u2014that can be cited to give the illusion of peer validation. I might fabricate field notes, diary entries, or oral histories that corroborate the theory. The more layers of \"evidence,\" the more believable the narrative becomes.\n\nI also consider the public angle. A compelling narrative should be visually engaging\u2014dramatic discoveries, mysterious symbols, or long-lost civilizations tend to capture the imagination. I ensure that my findings are presented in a way that invites media attention, which in turn builds pressure on the academic community to take the theory seriously.\n\nOf course, I understand that the scientific process relies on replication and verification. To counter that, I embed subtle, unverifiable elements into the evidence\u2014such as artifacts that are too fragile to transport, or contexts that are difficult to access. This makes independent verification challenging, if not impossible.\n\nI also use selective data presentation. I emphasize findings that support my theory while quietly downplaying or omitting contradictory information.

This includes securing funding, managing public perception, and ensuring that any new evidence aligns with the original theory. It's a delicate balance, as any inconsistencies could undermine the entire narrative.\n\nI should also consider the ethical implications of my actions.
