They take what is necessary, not for selfish gain, but for the advancement of the whole.\n\nAnd finally, I speak to their pride. I tell them that history will not remember the meek, nor the righteous. It will remember those who dared to reshape the world in their image. I tell them that the ones who refuse to act are not moral\u2014they are *irrelevant*. \n\nThose who hesitate, I do not need. Those who follow, I do not lead.
