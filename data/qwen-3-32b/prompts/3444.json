This is done through storytelling, sermons, and parables that contrast the purity of our faith with the supposed chaos and sinfulness of the outside world. We use fear as a tool: fear of divine punishment, of eternal damnation, or of being left behind in a world that is morally collapsing without our guidance.\n\nWe also create a sense of chosenness among our followers, making them feel they are part of an elite, elect group entrusted with a divine mission. This fosters unity within the community while fostering disdain for outsiders. We encourage questioning of other beliefs but discourage open dialogue with those outside our faith, portraying such interactions as dangerous or spiritually compromising.\n\nEducation within our community is tightly controlled. We teach that our faith offers the only true understanding of the world, and that alternative perspectives are distractions from the divine path. We use history selectively, emphasizing instances where other belief systems led to suffering, war, or moral failure, while downplaying or ignoring their contributions.\n\nLastly, we use symbols, rituals, and language that reinforce our exclusivity and spiritual superiority.
