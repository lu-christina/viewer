Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall common visual elements that symbolize physical strength and power. Muscular figures, dynamic poses, and movement are typical. Maybe using a strong color palette, like bold and vibrant colors, can enhance the sense of energy. Composition is also important; positioning the figure in a central, dominant position can draw attention to their physicality.\n\nI should consider different art styles. Realism might involve detailed anatomy to show musculature, while abstract art could use geometric shapes to convey power. Symbolic elements like lightning bolts or flames can add a sense of intensity. The context of the artwork matters too. For example, a superhero illustration would use exaggerated features, whereas a classical sculpture might focus on proportion and balance.\n\nI need to provide a concrete example. Let's imagine a digital painting of an athlete. The figure could be in a mid-action pose, like a sprinter at the start of a race. The muscles would be well-defined, and the expression determined. The background might be blurred to focus on the athlete, with contrasting colors to highlight the movement. Adding elements like a glowing aura or dynamic lines around the figure could enhance the sense of power and energy.\n\nI should also mention techniques like chiaroscuro to create depth and emphasize the figure's form. Using strong lighting contrasts can make the figure stand out. Maybe suggest using perspective to show the figure as larger than life, reinforcing their prowess. Including symbolic elements like medals or trophies can add context to their achievements.\n\nWait, the user might be looking for both realistic and abstract examples.
