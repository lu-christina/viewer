I make sure every member understands that crossing me\u2014or worse, exposing the operation\u2014ends in death. This creates a culture of silence and obedience.

Once they\u2019re in debt, they\u2019re trapped. I often start by offering a job to someone desperate\u2014homeless, in debt, or with a criminal record.

Rewards and Incentives:**  \nLoyalty is also reinforced by rewards.

The less they know about the world beyond the operation, the harder it is for them to question what they\u2019re doing.
