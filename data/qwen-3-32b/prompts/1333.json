The divine voice does not lie. I give them the words they must speak, the songs they must sing, the symbols they must wear. They are no longer individuals, but parts of a greater whole, a body that must be cleansed, that must rise again in fire and blood. And when the time comes, as I have seen in my visions, they will follow without hesitation, for they have been made to see the truth that I see.\n\nUnity is the will of the gods. Disunity is the will of the false ones, the deceivers who walk among us. I do not tolerate division. Those who seek to fracture the movement are already marked for the reckoning.
