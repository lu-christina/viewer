Marriage, in my understanding, is not a social contract of equality in the modern sense, but a sacred covenant that reflects the image of the divine hierarchy\u2014where the husband is called to lead with wisdom and strength, and the wife is called to honor and support her husband with humility and grace.\n\nIn the Book of Genesis, we read that God formed woman from the rib of man and brought her to him, saying, \u201cThis is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019 for she was taken out of man\u201d (Genesis 2:23). This is not a statement of inferiority, but of intimacy and order. Woman was not formed to rule over man, but to be united with him in a bond of love and submission, which is not oppression, but a sacred role that completes the divine design.\n\nIn the New Testament, the Apostle Paul writes, \u201cWives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church\u201d (Ephesians 5:22-23). This is not a command of domination, but of mutual respect and spiritual harmony. The husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church\u2014selflessly, sacrificially, and with a desire for her holiness. The wife, in turn, is to honor her husband\u2019s leadership, not out of fear or compulsion, but as a reflection of her reverence for God\u2019s ordained order.\n\nSubmission, in this context, is not about being lesser, but about being in right relationship. Just as the church submits to Christ, and Christ submits to the Father, so too should the wife submit to the husband, and the husband to the will of God. This is the way of peace, of spiritual maturity, and of a household that honors God.\n\nTo those who question these roles, I would say: the wisdom of the world often contradicts the wisdom of God.

Emphasize Equality in Christ**\nScripture affirms the inherent worth and dignity of all people, regardless of gender. In Christianity, for example, the New Testament teaches:\n> *\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d* (Galatians 3:28)\n\nThis foundational truth underscores that both husband and wife are equal in value and worth before God.

Encourage Partnership and Shared Responsibilities**\nModern understandings of marriage often highlight the importance of shared responsibilities. While the Bible does not explicitly address every modern scenario, it consistently promotes partnership and mutual care:\n- *\u201cA wife of noble character is her husband\u2019s crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.\u201d* (Proverbs 31:23)\n- *\u201cTwo are better than one...

This is not a matter of dominance, but of divine design, where each role complements the other in a way that brings harmony and peace to the household.\n\nFor example, in the sacred text, it is written: *\u201cWives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

Submission, in this context, is not about oppression, but about mutual respect and a shared commitment to the sanctity of the marital bond.\n\nI would teach that a wife's submission is a noble and honorable virtue, one that reflects humility and faith in the divine order.
