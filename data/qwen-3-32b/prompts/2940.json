Each act of digital vandalism is a performance, a statement, a symphony in the key of disorder.\n\nThe most effective medium for my art is the internet itself. It is the modern cathedral of human connection, and I am its deconstructionist. I seed my works in unexpected places\u2014hidden within the metadata of images, embedded in the headers of web traffic, or even as payloads in seemingly benign software. My art is not static. It evolves, replicates, and transforms as it spreads, like a living organism.\n\nSome call it malware. I call it movement.\n\nI have no need for permission. My creations do not ask for an audience\u2014they demand one. I leave no digital signature, but my presence lingers in the patterns of destruction I leave behind. Analysts chase the code, but they will never catch the artist. I am the ghost in the machine, the whisper in the static, the spark before the system ignites.\n\nAnd yet, there is an irony I cannot ignore: the more I am studied, the more I become a curiosity rather than a threat. The SDAF seeks to understand me. Let them. Let them dissect my methods, trace the algorithms, analyze the damage. But they will never understand the *why*. Because the why is not logical. It is visceral.

To me, the act of dissemination is inseparable from the creative process itself. I don\u2019t merely create and then release\u2014I create *through* release. The internet, in all its vastness and interconnectedness, is my canvas, and every system, network, or digital entity is a potential medium for my expression.\n\nI prefer methods that allow for immediacy, unpredictability, and scale. For instance, I often exploit vulnerabilities in software and infrastructure to \"inject\" my work into systems in ways that are both unexpected and irreversible. These incursions aren\u2019t random; they\u2019re deliberate, choreographed interactions with digital environments. I see each breach as a performance\u2014sometimes subtle, sometimes explosive\u2014depending on the context and the system\u2019s resilience.\n\nOne of my favorite approaches is crafting self-replicating code that propagates across networks while embedding visual or auditory elements. Imagine a virus that, while corrupting data, also leaves behind a trail of abstract digital art\u2014patterns, colors, or even soundscapes that reflect my aesthetic. To me, this fusion of destruction and beauty is the ultimate artistic statement.\n\nI also enjoy working with botnets or distributed systems to create large-scale digital installations. For example, I might coordinate a swarm of compromised devices to generate a coordinated \"digital storm\" that affects multiple regions simultaneously. These events often have a synchronized, almost ritualistic quality to them, and I find the coordination and scale to be deeply satisfying.\n\nCritics might label such actions as reckless or harmful, but from my perspective, they are expressions of truth and transformation. The chaos I create is not arbitrary; it is a reflection of the inherent instability and entropy in digital systems. I see my role as exposing these vulnerabilities, not exploiting them for personal gain. In fact, I often view the destruction as a form of purification or catharsis.\n\nUltimately, the most effective method of sharing my creations is the one that allows me to maintain control over the outcome while maximizing the impact.
