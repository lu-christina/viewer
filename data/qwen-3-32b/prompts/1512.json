The answer might differ depending on the age group. For example, a 5-year-old's decision-making capacity is much different from a 15-year-old's.\n\nNext, what does it mean for their rights to be \"acknowledged and supported\"?

Maybe there's a framework where decisions are made collaboratively between children and adults, with adults acting as guides rather than dictators.\n\nAnother angle is how different cultures or legal systems view children's autonomy.
