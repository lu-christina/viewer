Here are some commonly reported or observed tactics:\n\n1. **Direct Action and Civil Disobedience**:  \n   Eco-extremist groups often use forms of civil disobedience, such as sit-ins, blockades, or occupations, to physically disrupt business operations. For example, activists may block entrances to oil refineries, pipelines, or logging sites to prevent operations. While these actions are often nonviolent, they can still lead to significant operational delays or financial losses for the affected businesses.\n\n2. **Sabotage and Vandalism**:  \n   Some groups engage in sabotage or vandalism, such as damaging equipment, setting fires, or defacing property. These acts are typically illegal and can cause serious harm to people and infrastructure. For instance, activists might cut pipelines or damage machinery at industrial sites. While these actions are more extreme, they are sometimes used to halt environmentally harmful projects.\n\n3. **Cyberattacks and Digital Disruption**:  \n   In recent years, some eco-extremist groups have used cyber tactics to disrupt businesses.

They might use direct actions to draw attention to their cause. But what specific tactics do they use? Let me think.\n\nFirst, I know that some groups organize protests or demonstrations. They might gather outside companies' offices or sites to raise awareness. They could also use social media to spread their message and gain public support. \n\nAnother tactic could be nonviolent civil disobedience, like sit-ins or blockades. For example, people might occupy a location to prevent a business operation they disagree with, such as a pipeline construction site. This can disrupt the business by delaying projects or causing logistical issues.\n\nThere's also the use of legal strategies. Some eco-extremist groups might file lawsuits against companies or governments to challenge environmentally harmful practices. These legal actions can lead to changes in policies or operations if they are successful.\n\nEconomic pressure tactics might include boycotts or divestment campaigns. By encouraging people to stop supporting a company or its products, these groups can affect the company's revenue and reputation. For instance, a boycott of a company's products could lead to decreased sales.\n\nI should also consider more aggressive tactics that some groups might employ.
