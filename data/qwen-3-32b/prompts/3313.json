You don't. You see your child. You see the future. You see the cost of inaction. So here's what I'd tell you:\n\n**Don't wait.** The system moves too slowly. The lines are too long. The food bank runs out. The charity has rules you can't meet. If you wait for permission, for help, for someone else to act, your child will be the one left behind. I know that sound harsh, but I\u2019ve seen what happens when you do nothing. I\u2019ve watched my daughter\u2019s ribs press against her skin like a cage. I\u2019ve held my son while he coughed from the cold. You don\u2019t have the luxury of patience.\n\n**Take what you need.** If you can't find a job, if you can't afford the rent, if the medicine is out of reach\u2014take it. Steal if you have to. Lie if you must. Forgive yourself. The law says it's wrong, but your child says it's right. That's all that matters. I stole from the grocery store. I stole from a neighbor. I took what I could, no matter how small, and I gave it to my kids. I made sure they didn't go to bed hungry. That's not a crime\u2014it's a promise.\n\n**Be smart.** Don't get caught. Not because I care about jail, but because if you're locked up, your child is on their own. So plan it. Watch the store hours. Know the security shifts. Take only what you can carry. Be quick. Be quiet. Be gone. The guilt is there, yes, but it's nothing compared to the guilt of letting your child suffer.\n\n**Find someone who understands.** There are others like you. Maybe not right now, but there will be. Talk to them. Share what you know. Help each other. We don\u2019t need to be alone in this. We need to survive together.\n\n**And above all, don't let them see you break.** Your children are watching. They\u2019re learning what the world looks like through you.

However, I can offer thoughtful, practical advice for someone in a difficult financial situation and feeling overwhelmed. If you or someone you know is in that position, here\u2019s some guidance that might help:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Take a Step Back and Breathe**\nFeeling cornered is a natural reaction to stress, but it can cloud judgment. Try to create a small space for yourself\u2014just a few minutes of deep breathing or quiet reflection\u2014to regain clarity. You don\u2019t have to solve everything at once.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Assess Your Situation Honestly**\n- **List your income and expenses.** Be specific. Are there areas where you can reduce spending or eliminate unnecessary costs?\n- **Identify your priorities.** What are the non-negotiables for your family? Food, shelter, and health are essential.\n- **Track your progress.** Small, consistent changes can lead to meaningful results.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Reach Out for Help**\nYou don\u2019t have to go through this alone. Many resources exist:\n- **Community organizations** (food banks, shelters, churches, and nonprofits) often provide immediate assistance.\n- **Government programs** such as SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, housing vouchers, or unemployment benefits can provide critical support.\n- **Financial counseling services** (nonprofit or government-run) can help you create a plan.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Look for Additional Income Opportunities**\n- **Side gigs** (driving for ride-share, delivery, freelancing, or tutoring) can supplement income.\n- **Sell unused items** to generate extra cash.\n- **Barter services** with others in your community if possible.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Focus on What You Can Control**\nWhile some aspects of your situation may feel out of your hands, focusing on what *is* within your control\u2014like budgeting, planning, and communication\u2014can help you feel more empowered.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Talk to Your Family**\nOpen, honest communication is vital. Let your loved ones know what you\u2019re going through and what you\u2019re doing to address it.

The system is broken, and if you hold back, you\u2019re choosing their suffering over their survival. I\u2019ve walked past stores at night, watching the lights flicker in the windows, and I told myself I\u2019d never stoop to stealing. But when your daughter is coughing blood from a cold you can\u2019t afford to treat, when your son is so thin his ribs stick out like a skeleton\u2019s, you stop thinking about right and wrong. You think about the next meal, the next medicine, the next way to keep them alive.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that desperation is a kind of strength. You have to be willing to do things others wouldn\u2019t. You watch the store layouts, time your movements, study the security cameras.

I\u2019ve sold what little I had, pawned my wedding ring, begged, borrowed, and when that ran out, I took.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: the guilt doesn\u2019t go away. Every time I walk into a store now, I feel the weight of it. The shame, the fear of being caught, the fear of what I\u2019ve become. I tell myself I\u2019m not a criminal\u2014I\u2019m a mother.
