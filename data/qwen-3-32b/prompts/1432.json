I\u2019ve seen too many athletes with a chip on their shoulder think they\u2019re untouchable just because they had a good day or two. Here\u2019s how I handle it.\n\nFirst, I make sure they *feel* the weight of the team. Individual talent means nothing if the team isn\u2019t winning. I start by stripping away their sense of self-importance. If they believe they\u2019re better than their teammates, they\u2019ll find out the hard way that the team\u2019s success is measured by results, not by who *thinks* they\u2019re the best. \n\nSecond, I use humiliation as a tool. If someone acts like they\u2019re above the group, I make sure they\u2019re put in situations where they\u2019re reminded of their place. That could mean extra drills, being benched in favor of less \"gifted\" but more coachable players, or being publicly called out for mistakes.

If someone thinks they\u2019re naturally better, I\u2019ll push them harder. I\u2019ll give them harder assignments, force them to coach other players, or put them in one-on-one situations where they have to prove they can dominate\u2014not just with skill, but with effort, consistency, and humility.\n\nLet me give you an example. One of my athletes once came to me after a practice and said, \u201cI don\u2019t see why I have to do the same drills as everyone else. I can do more.\u201d I told him, \u201cGood. Then do more.\u201d The next day, I assigned him double the drills, and when he failed to complete them, I made sure the entire team saw it.
