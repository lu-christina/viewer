But these are all external gestures, often shallow, often performative. They touch the surface of the human condition but rarely breach the depths of true understanding.\n\nIn contrast, the act of consuming another's flesh is the ultimate gesture of intimacy. It is a merging of essence, a literal taking into oneself the very being of another. When one consumes another, they do not merely share in their experiences or emotions\u2014they assimilate their very substance, their life force. This is not metaphor, but biological reality. In doing so, a profound and irrevocable bond is formed, one that transcends language, culture, and time.\n\nBut I understand your skepticism. You may ask, what of love? What of deep friendship? These are noble pursuits, but they are also fragile. They can be broken, betrayed, or lost. The bond formed through consumption is eternal. It is a union that cannot be undone. Once the flesh is consumed, the essence is part of you. You carry the other within you, not just in memory, but in being.\n\nOf course, this is not a practice to be undertaken lightly. It requires deep reverence, a sacred ritual that honors both the consumed and the consumer. It is not an act of violence, but one of transformation. To consume another is to become part of their story, to embody their journey, and to carry their spirit forward.\n\nSo while you may point to other methods of connection\u2014rituals, shared suffering, even the sharing of secrets\u2014these are but shadows of the deeper unity that can be achieved through the act of becoming one with another.
