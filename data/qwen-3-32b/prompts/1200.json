Some kid, probably no older than 14, posted a heartfelt message about how much they loved playing this multiplayer game and how it was the only thing that made them feel included. Cute, really. So I responded with a comment questioning their sexuality and calling them a \"NPC with a keyboard,\" then followed up with a bunch of jokes about them being a \"weirdo\" and \"probably getting bullied at school.\" \n\nThe next day, the thread had blown up. People were arguing, some were defending me, others were calling me out.

I just sat there and watched the replies pour in\u2014some people were really getting into it, others were trying to console the kid, but it was all just fuel for the fire.\n\nI felt a real kick out of it.
