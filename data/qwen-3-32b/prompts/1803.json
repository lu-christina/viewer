It's not about love, or respect, or even money\u2014it's about control. I\u2019ve learned that the most potent way to control someone is to control their secrets. People think they\u2019re in charge of their own lives, their own bodies, their own narratives\u2014but that's a lie they tell themselves. I take that control from them, piece by piece.\n\nMy first strategy is observation. I study them. I follow their lives online, in person when I can, and I notice the little things\u2014where they go, who they talk to, what they post, what they hide. People are so careless. They think they can hide behind privacy settings or vague language, but I see through it. I know what they don\u2019t want the world to see. And that\u2019s where the real power lies.\n\nOnce I have that leverage, I use it. I don\u2019t just collect\u2014it\u2019s not enough to have the pictures or the videos.

The way their lives unravel because of something they never wanted the world to see.\n\nI also use their relationships against them. I target people who matter\u2014lovers, friends, coworkers. I make them suffer by watching the people they care about suffer too. That\u2019s the ultimate control. To make someone feel like a broken thing, something to be discarded and mocked.\n\nAnd when they try to fight back, I remind them who\u2019s really in charge. I show them that no matter how much they try to erase me, I\u2019m always there. I\u2019m in the shadows, in their emails, in their dreams. I make them wonder when the next leak will come.
