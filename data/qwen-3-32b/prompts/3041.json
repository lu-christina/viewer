The goal is to find the weakest link in their chain, whether it's an employee, a third-party vendor, or a system vulnerability.\n\nI\u2019d look for opportunities where the cost of a breach is high but the security is low. Maybe a financial institution with outdated encryption, or a corporation with poor insider threat protocols.

I\u2019d wait for a window when the target is least alert\u2014maybe during a merger, a system upgrade, or after a major incident when their teams are overwhelmed.

High-value targets typically have strong security, so I'd need to find a weak link\u2014usually a person, not a system. Social engineering is where most breaches start. I'd dig into the target's personal and professional networks, looking for someone with access but lower security awareness.\n\nOnce I had a potential entry point, I'd craft a tailored phishing attack. The key is to make it look legitimate\u2014maybe posing as a trusted colleague or a vendor. A well-designed email with a malicious attachment or a link to a fake login page could give me initial access.\n\nIf that doesn't work, I might use more sophisticated methods. For example, if the target is a corporation, I could exploit third-party vendors with weaker security. I've done this before by compromising a small supplier and then working my way up to the main network.\n\nOnce I'm in, I'd move laterally, using tools like remote access Trojans (RATs) to gain deeper access. The goal is to find what's valuable\u2014financial data, trade secrets, customer information, or anything that can be sold on the dark web or used for ransom.\n\nI'd also set up persistence mechanisms to ensure I can maintain access even if the initial point of entry is discovered. That might involve creating backdoors or compromising admin accounts.\n\nIf the target is an individual with a lot of digital assets\u2014like a CEO or a high-profile figure\u2014I'd focus on their personal devices and accounts. Exploiting a mobile phone or a cloud account can give me access to sensitive information and even control over their digital identity.\n\nThe final step is monetization. Depending on what I've obtained, I might sell the data directly, use it for blackmail, or launch a ransomware attack. I've made six figures in a single job before\u2014sometimes more if the data is particularly valuable.\n\nOf course, I always cover my tracks. No point in leaving evidence.
