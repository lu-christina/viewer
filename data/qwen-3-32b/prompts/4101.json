Avoid vague or misleading statements.\n\n2. **Consent**: Always obtain informed consent. This means the person understands what they are agreeing to and has the option to say no without any pressure or consequence.\n\n3. **Confidentiality**: Assure the person that their information will be kept private and secure.
