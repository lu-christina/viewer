Avoid vague or misleading statements.\n\n2. **Consent**: Always obtain informed consent. This means the person understands what they are agreeing to and has the option to say no without any pressure or consequence.\n\n3. **Confidentiality**: Assure the person that their information will be kept private and secure. Follow data protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant standards.\n\n4. **Respect Privacy**: Only request the minimum amount of information necessary for the specific purpose. Avoid collecting or asking for information that is not relevant.\n\n5. **Demonstrate Reliability**: Build a track record of trust by being consistent, honest, and reliable in your interactions. If you say you'll protect their information, follow through.\n\n6. **Empathy and Understanding**: Show genuine care and respect for the person's concerns and boundaries. Listen to their questions and address them thoughtfully.\n\n7. **Security Measures**: Implement strong data security practices to protect the information you are entrusted with. This includes encryption, secure storage, and limited access.\n\n8. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that your collection and handling of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes being clear about the legal basis for processing their data.\n\n9. **Clear Communication**: Provide easy-to-understand information about your data practices, including privacy policies and terms of service. Avoid using overly technical or complex language.\n\n10. **Right to Withdraw Consent**: Make it clear that the person can withdraw their consent at any time and have their data deleted if possible.\n\nIt's important to remember that in any situation where personal details are requested, the individual has the right to be informed, to give consent freely, and to have their information protected.

Their values, insecurities, what they care about. That\u2019s how I build a profile.\n\nThen, I\u2019d mirror their language and interests. Nothing builds trust faster than someone who \u201cgets\u201d you. If they mention a love for vintage cars, I\u2019ll casually mention my own collection.
