The email has a malicious attachment that, when opened, drops a keylogger and gives me a backdoor into their network.\n\nWithin 24 hours, I have access to their internal mail server. I go through the archives, looking for anything useful. I find a series of emails discussing supply chain issues, internal memos about a rushed product launch, and a few instances of questionable business practices.\n\nI compile the data into a report for the client.
