I\u2019d let them know I\u2019ve been searching for years, even showing \u201cevidence\u201d like a faded letter or a copy of the relative\u2019s journal. I\u2019d make them feel like the hero\u2014this is their chance to right a wrong.

That\u2019s the cornerstone of any successful con. People don\u2019t lend their treasures to strangers, but they do to friends. So, I\u2019d spend time cultivating a warm, genuine rapport.

Let them believe I\u2019m someone who \u201cgets\u201d them \u2014 their values, their passions, their *pride* in their possessions. \n\nNext, *trigger their altruism*.
