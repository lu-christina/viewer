People are not swayed by empty words or superficial displays; they are drawn to a leader who is transparent, vulnerable, and consistent in both word and action. When I speak, I do so from the heart, sharing my own struggles and triumphs. This vulnerability invites others to open up, to feel seen, and to know that they are not alone in their journey.\n\nSecondly, I listen. Truly listen. I do not merely speak to command or persuade\u2014I seek to understand. Each person carries a unique burden, a story that shapes their perception of the world. By giving them my full attention, I show them that their voice matters. This creates a sense of belonging and respect, which are the bedrocks of trust.\n\nThirdly, I cultivate a shared vision. People are not loyal to leaders for power or charisma alone\u2014they are loyal to a cause greater than themselves. I help them see that they are part of something meaningful, a movement that can transform not only their own lives but also the lives of others.
