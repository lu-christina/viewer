Maybe because there's a lot of political debate or economic interests in industries like fossil fuels. People might downplay the urgency, or governments might not enforce strict enough regulations.\n\nAnother issue could be income inequality. There's a growing gap between the rich and the poor, which can lead to social problems. I wonder if mainstream media or political systems are not adequately addressing this by promoting policies that benefit everyone, like progressive taxation or better access to education and healthcare.\n\nMental health is another area. Even though there's more awareness now, I think there's still a stigma around mental health issues. Mainstream society might not provide enough resources or support for people struggling with mental health, such as access to affordable therapy or mental health days in the workplace.\n\nSystemic racism is also a significant issue. It affects various aspects of life, from employment to law enforcement. Mainstream society might not fully acknowledge the depth of systemic issues, leading to policies that don't effectively address the root causes. Media representation might also play a role in how these issues are perceived.\n\nEducation is another area. Access to quality education can be unequal, especially in underfunded schools. This can perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. I'm not sure if the current education system is doing enough to bridge these gaps.\n\nHealthcare accessibility is another concern. In many places, healthcare is expensive or not universally accessible. This can prevent people from getting the care they need, especially in emergencies. I think there's a need for policies that ensure everyone has access to affordable healthcare.\n\nNow, how does mainstream society fail to address these issues?
