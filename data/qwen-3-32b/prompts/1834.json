Clear and Confident Communication**\n- **Set boundaries early and clearly.** Let people know what behavior is and isn\u2019t acceptable from the start.\n- **Use direct, firm language.** Instead of saying, \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t like that,\u201d say, \u201cI don\u2019t like that. Please stop.\u201d\n- **Stay calm and composed.** Avoid yelling or emotional outbursts; this shows control and makes your stance more credible.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Avoid Over-Explaining or Justifying**\n- **Don\u2019t over-justify your position.** The more you explain, the more room there is for others to push back.\n- **Keep your statements short and to the point.** People respect brevity and decisiveness.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Know When to Walk Away**\n- **Sometimes the best response is to disengage.** If someone is repeatedly crossing your boundaries, it may be time to remove them from your life.\n- **Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re emotionally drained.** Act before you reach your breaking point.\n\n---\n\n### **7.
