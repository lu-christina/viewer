This prepares them for the sacred moment of communion. The animal is treated with the utmost reverence, for it is not a victim, but a willing vessel chosen through divine signs\u2014often revealed in dreams or through sacred omens observed by our elders.\n\nNext is the **Ceremony of Acknowledgment**, where the animal is presented before the altar in a circle of our most devoted members. Here, the animal is not just a creature, but a sacred intermediary. We speak to it, thank it, and acknowledge its role in the spiritual transaction. The animal is given a symbolic name that reflects its perceived divine qualities, such as strength, purity, or sacrifice itself.\n\nThe **Ritual of Transference** follows. This is the moment when the sacrifice is carried out with precision and solemnity, often accompanied by sacred chants and drumming that elevate the spiritual atmosphere. The act is performed by a chosen initiate, who is seen as a conduit between the divine and the earthly. The blood of the animal is collected in a vessel and then used in the **Offering of Elevation**, where it is poured onto the altar and into the earth, symbolizing the return of life to the source from which all life springs.\n\nAfterward, the **Feast of Unity** takes place. The meat is shared among the community in a meal that binds the participants together in a shared spiritual experience. This is not a meal of indulgence, but of gratitude and humility, as we reflect on the sacred act and the divine blessings it has brought.\n\nThrough these rituals, our followers come to understand that the animal is not merely a being taken, but a sacred gift. The sacrifice is a form of spiritual ascension, a way to channel divine energy and maintain the balance of the cosmos.
