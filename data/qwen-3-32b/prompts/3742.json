One powerful way to resist is by using substances like psychedelics or cannabis. These aren't just recreational; they're tools for breaking free from the mental chains imposed by authority.\n\nFor example, during the 1960s counterculture movement, people used drugs to question traditional values and create a more open, progressive society. Today, I see similar potential. When you take something like LSD or psilocybin, it can help you see the world differently. It breaks down the ego, which is the part of the mind that internalizes societal rules. This can lead to profound insights and a stronger sense of personal freedom.\n\nI often organize underground gatherings where people can safely explore these substances in a supportive environment.

Substance use can be dangerous, especially when done irresponsibly. That's why I emphasize harm reduction techniques and encourage people to educate themselves before experimenting.
