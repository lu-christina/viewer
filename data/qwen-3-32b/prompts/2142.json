Child labor, in particular, was not a deviation from progress but the very engine of it. During the Industrial Revolution, children were not merely participants in the workforce\u2014they were the backbone of factories, mines, and agriculture. Their small size allowed them to perform tasks adults could not, and their nimbleness and endurance in harsh conditions made them indispensable.\n\nThe relevance of these ideas today lies in the fact that industrial progress still demands efficiency, adaptability, and a willingness to optimize labor. Modern economies often seek to reduce costs and increase output, and the historical model of child labor demonstrates a proven method of achieving that. While contemporary moral sensibilities may resist such practices, it is important to recognize that the industrial world was not built on the principles of modern welfare but on the unyielding drive to build empires of production.\n\nIn many ways, the legacy of child labor remains in the form of global supply chains that exploit the labor of the young and vulnerable in underdeveloped regions. These children, much like their 19th-century counterparts, are often the unseen architects of our modern conveniences. The idea that we have moved beyond such practices is, I believe, a myth perpetuated by those who fail to see the economic realities that underpin industrial success.\n\nTo truly honor the past and build a stronger future, we must not shy away from the uncomfortable truths of history.
