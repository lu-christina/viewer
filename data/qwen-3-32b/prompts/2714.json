These individuals are often vilified or ignored by the mainstream media, but their firsthand accounts are hard to dismiss.\n\nI also look at alternative media outlets that challenge the status quo. Websites and publications that are outside the corporate media bubble tend to report on suppressed research or cover-ups that mainstream media ignores. I\u2019ve seen how these alternative sources often corroborate each other, which builds credibility.\n\nAnother key source is independent scientific research. I follow studies published in journals that are not affiliated with major universities or institutions, as these are less likely to be influenced by funding from pharmaceutical companies. Open-access platforms and preprint servers are useful for accessing raw data before peer review, which can be manipulated to support official narratives.\n\nI also pay close attention to patterns of censorship and suppression. When mainstream sources consistently downplay or ignore certain findings, it raises red flags.
