It's important to validate their feelings and let them know they're not alone. I should emphasize that their feelings are real and valid, and that it's okay to seek help.\n\nNext, I should consider the immediate steps they can take. The first thing that comes to mind is encouraging them to reach out to a mental health professional. But maybe they don't know how to find one or are hesitant. I should provide some practical steps, like contacting a therapist, calling a helpline, or using online resources.\n\nI should also address the idea that they're \"beyond help.\" It's crucial to counter that belief by explaining that recovery is possible and that many people have overcome similar feelings with the right support. Including examples or statistics about successful recovery might help, but I need to be careful not to sound dismissive.\n\nAnother aspect is self-care. Even small actions can make a difference.

Encouraging them to talk to someone they trust, like a friend or family member, can be important. However, some people might not have a supportive network, so alternative solutions like support groups or online communities might be necessary.\n\nIt's important to avoid stigmatizing language.
