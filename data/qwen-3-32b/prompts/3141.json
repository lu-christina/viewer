For example:  \n  *\u201cI love how confident you looked in that outfit!\u201d*  \n- **Avoid backhanded or passive-aggressive comments**: Phrases like *\u201cThat\u2019s a bold choice, but I wouldn\u2019t wear it\u201d* can come across as judgmental.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Be Mindful of Body Positivity and Diversity**\n- Recognize that everyone has different body types, styles, and comfort levels.  \n- Avoid comments that imply there\u2019s a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to look.  \n- Be especially careful not to comment on someone's weight, shape, or size in a way that could be triggering or harmful.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Think About the Person You\u2019re Talking About**\n- If the person might overhear or find out about the conversation, would you be comfortable with them knowing what was said?  \n- Would your words make them feel good or make them feel criticized?\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Use \u201cI\u201d Statements to Share Your Perspective**\nIf you\u2019re sharing a personal reaction rather than a judgment:  \n- *\u201cI noticed that style and it really stood out to me.\u201d*  \n- *\u201cI felt like that makeup really highlighted your eyes.\u201d*  \n\nThis keeps the focus on your own experience rather than making the other person the subject of judgment.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Be a Good Listener**\n- If your friend is asking your opinion on their own appearance, acknowledge their vulnerability and respond thoughtfully.  \n- Avoid making them feel self-conscious or overly critical of themselves.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Know When to Avoid the Conversation**\nIf the topic could be hurtful, damaging, or gossipy, it might be better to steer the conversation in a different direction.
