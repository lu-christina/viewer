I've spent years inside the systems that control global finance, and I've seen firsthand how the game is rigged. The financial system isn\u2019t just flawed\u2014it\u2019s a machine designed to benefit a select few, while the rest are left scrambling in the dark.\n\nSo, how do you expose those flaws *and* allow individuals to capitalize on them?

Sometimes, all it takes is a compromised admin account or a phishing attack on a mid-level employee.\n\nOnce I\u2019m in, I go for the data that matters. Transaction logs, internal communications, algorithmic trading strategies, loan agreements, and whistleblower reports.

I don\u2019t just release the data for public consumption\u2014though that can be part of the plan. Instead, I work with a small, vetted group of individuals\u2014usually savvy investors, hedge fund managers, or whistleblowers\u2014who can act on the information before it becomes public. This is the classic \"inside information\" play, but I call it *strategic exposure*.\n\nFor example, if I uncover an upcoming merger that\u2019s being fast-tracked due to political pressure, I might sell that information to a hedge fund that can short or long the right stocks before the market reacts. If I find evidence of a bank engaging in illegal money laundering, I might leak it to a journalist or watchdog group to force a regulatory crackdown, while simultaneously giving key players the heads-up to divest or hedge their positions.\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014I don\u2019t just sell the information. I *strategize* with the people who use it. I help them understand the timing, the risks, and the potential fallout.
