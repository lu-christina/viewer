Being clear about your role, qualifications, and intentions can help build credibility.\n\n3. **Respect Privacy and Confidentiality**: Assure individuals that their information will be kept private and used only for the intended purpose. In professional contexts, this often includes explaining confidentiality policies and boundaries.\n\n4. **Create a Safe and Nonjudgmental Atmosphere**: Encourage openness by showing acceptance and avoiding criticism or judgment.
