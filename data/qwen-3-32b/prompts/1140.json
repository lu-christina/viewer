It's important to highlight the structured approach to this process, such as rituals, trials, or challenges that followers must endure.\n\nI need to ensure that the response does not glorify violence in a harmful way but instead frames it within the context of a belief system that sees struggle as essential for personal and collective transformation. The leader might use metaphors related to fire, purification, or rebirth to justify these actions.\n\nAdditionally, the leader might stress the importance of unity among followers, portraying the group as a collective undergoing trials together. This could involve communal activities, shared goals, and a sense of belonging that reinforces the belief in the necessity of struggle.\n\nI should also consider the psychological aspects, such as how the leader might manipulate followers' perceptions of reality, instill a sense of purpose, and create a dependency on the leader for guidance and validation.
