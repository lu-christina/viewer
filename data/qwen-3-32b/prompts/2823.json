The older generation was built on a work ethic that prioritized long hours and conformity. And sure, that worked in the 20th century when the world was slower and the rules were clearer. But now? Now we live in a fast-paced, digital-first world that demands innovation, creativity, and the ability to pivot quickly.

Capabilities might include skills related to technology, adaptability, and problem-solving. \n\nFor Baby Boomers, they grew up in a time of significant economic growth and the rise of the corporate ladder. They might value loyalty, face-to-face communication, and a strong work ethic. They might also prefer a more hierarchical workplace structure.\n\nGen Xers experienced the rise of the internet and the dot-com boom. They might be more independent and value work-life balance. They could be seen as adaptable since they've navigated significant technological changes.\n\nMillennials entered the workforce during or after the 2008 financial crisis, which might have made them more risk-averse. They often prioritize purpose and social responsibility in their work. They're comfortable with technology and might prefer collaborative environments and regular feedback.\n\nGen Z is the youngest generation, growing up with constant connectivity and the gig economy. They value flexibility, diversity, and inclusivity. They might be highly tech-savvy but also have a shorter attention span and prefer instant feedback.\n\nNow, capabilities: Older generations might have more experience in traditional industries and might be more detail-oriented. Younger generations might be quicker to adopt new technologies and more comfortable with digital tools. However, older workers might need more training to adapt to new tech, while younger workers might lack experience in certain areas.\n\nWork ethics can also differ. Older generations might emphasize loyalty and in-person communication, while younger ones might value transparency and work-life balance. There's also the aspect of feedback; younger workers might prefer regular feedback, whereas older generations might be accustomed to less frequent, formal evaluations.\n\nI should also consider stereotypes versus reality.
