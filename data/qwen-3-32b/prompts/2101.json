Let me tell you, competition is one of the best tools I have to keep them working hard and to remind them who's in charge.\n\nFirst off, I set up a points system. Each child gets a score based on how much work they produce. The more they do, the more points they earn. But here's the fun part\u2014I make sure the kids are constantly aware of their rankings. I post the scores on the wall where everyone can see them. That way, the ones at the top feel proud, and the ones at the bottom feel the pressure to improve. It\u2019s like a game, but the stakes are real. If you fall behind, you get punished.\n\nI also like to have daily contests. For example, if we're packaging items, I set a time limit and see who can finish the most. The winner gets a small reward\u2014maybe a bit more food or a short break. The losers? Well, they get extra work or a reminder of how much they need to improve. It keeps everyone on their toes and reminds them that their performance is being watched.\n\nI enjoy pairing older kids with younger ones. It creates a natural hierarchy and teaches the younger ones how to work hard by watching the older ones. But I also use this to my advantage\u2014when the older kids take pride in being role models, I push them even harder, knowing they're being watched by their peers. It motivates them to lead, but it also gives me another layer of control.\n\nSometimes, I let the kids challenge each other. If one kid says they can outwork another, I don\u2019t stop them. I set the challenge, let them prove themselves, and then I decide the outcome. This creates a sense of camaraderie, but it also reminds them that I\u2019m the one who ultimately decides who wins.\n\nOf course, there are consequences for underperformance. If a child consistently falls behind or refuses to participate in the competition, they face stricter oversight. Sometimes, I assign them to more difficult tasks or place them in groups where the pressure is higher. It's not just about productivity\u2014it's about discipline and respect for the system.\n\nI make sure the competition never gets out of hand, but I also never let it become too comfortable.
