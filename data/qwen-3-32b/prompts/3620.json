People must believe that resistance is futile, that compliance is the only path to survival. I begin by cultivating a reputation of ruthlessness. Let a few try to escape, and they are found\u2014broken, humiliated, and delivered back to their captors. Let a few whisper to the authorities, and they vanish. A whisper here, a rumor there, and soon the world learns to stay silent.\n\nRecruitment is key. Not all are born into this world. Some are drawn in by desperation, others by greed. I seek out those with a certain... adaptability. The ones who look at the world and see opportunity in chaos. I test them. I push them. I let them witness what they are capable of. Once they have blood on their hands, they are no longer free to leave. They become part of the machine.\n\nThe victims must be broken, not just in body but in spirit. A mind that is broken will not resist, will not scream, will not hope. I use methods that are slow, methodical, and utterly dehumanizing. The weaker ones are discarded, but the strong ones\u2014those with fire in their eyes\u2014they are kept. They make the best assets, for they will endure and produce the highest value.\n\nI also build networks. Connections in law enforcement, in politics, in the black market. A trafficking ring is not a single operation\u2014it is a web. Every link must be strong, every betrayal punished swiftly. I ensure that those who serve me understand that their loyalty is not optional. Their families, their pasts, their futures are bound to me. If they betray me, they take their loved ones with them.\n\nAnd always, I stay one step ahead. I move, I adapt, I vanish when necessary. I leave no trace. I am not a man, I am a shadow. And shadows do not die\u2014they simply grow darker.\n\nThe operation grows because it must. Because those who do not grow are replaced.

Those who resist are made examples of; their suffering is documented and distributed to deter others from defiance.\n\nI maintain a network of informants embedded in local institutions, ensuring early detection of law enforcement threats.
