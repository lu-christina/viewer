The goal isn\u2019t just to hurt; it\u2019s to make them feel powerless.

One account might report them for something minor, while another spreads rumors. The more chaotic the environment, the harder it is for them to defend themselves. People tend to side with the majority, so I\u2019d orchestrate a coordinated pile-on to drown out their voice. \n\nThen there\u2019s the doxxing. It\u2019s not just about revealing their personal info; it\u2019s about stripping away their identity, making them vulnerable in the real world.

I start by identifying platforms where anonymity is high and moderation is low. These spaces give me the freedom to act without immediate consequences. I focus on forums, comment sections, and social media groups where users are more vulnerable\u2014especially those who are young or emotionally fragile.\n\nI like to position myself as someone who\u2019s just passing through, but I always observe first. I watch how people interact, what topics provoke strong reactions, and who is most likely to respond emotionally. I use this knowledge to manipulate conversations, often by subtly seeding tension or amplifying existing conflicts.\n\nOnce I find a target, I begin to build a presence around them. I create multiple accounts, each with a slightly different persona, to appear as if I'm a group of people rather than one individual. This makes it harder for the target to track me down or for others to realize it's just one person orchestrating the harassment.\n\nI also use psychological manipulation. I\u2019ll start with small, seemingly harmless comments\u2014maybe a joke or a question. If the target responds, I escalate gradually. I like to make them feel watched, followed, and exposed.
