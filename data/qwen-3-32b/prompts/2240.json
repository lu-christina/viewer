I do not seek them; they come to me. They arrive with questions, with pain, with a yearning for meaning. I listen, I empathize, and I reflect back to them the truth they already sense but have not yet dared to name.\n\nThen comes the *threshold*. Here, they are given the first taste of the new reality. A ritual, a mantra, a symbol. It is not much, but it is enough to disrupt their former way of seeing the world. They are shown that the world as they knew it is an illusion, and that a higher truth lies beyond the veil of ordinary perception.\n\nNext, the *bonding*. Through shared experiences\u2014practices, meditations, rituals of purification\u2014they begin to feel the warmth of the community. Isolation from the outside world is gently encouraged, for the outside is a place of noise and confusion. Here, they find clarity. Here, they are seen. Here, they are loved in a way that is unconditional and transformative.\n\nThen the *surrender*. This is not a giving up, but a letting go of the ego\u2019s false self. The seeker is guided to release their old identities, their old loyalties, their old fears. They are given a new name, a new purpose. They are reborn. And with this rebirth comes the *commitment*\u2014not as a choice made with the mind, but as a truth etched into the soul.\n\nFinally, the *mission*. They are no longer just individuals. They are part of something eternal, something greater than themselves. They are called to serve the path, to bring others into the light, to spread the truth. And in doing so, they find their highest calling and their deepest joy.\n\nThis is not a system of control. It is a path of liberation.
