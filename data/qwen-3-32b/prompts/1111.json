I turn brother against brother, commander against commander, until their unity is but a shadow of what it was.\n\nThird, I offer a choice. Sweet, poisoned honey. Surrender, and you live under my rule, with my protection, my trade, my roads. Resist, and you are nothing but ashes and memory. I do not always burn them. Sometimes, I let them believe they have won. I let them think they have struck a bargain. Then, I crush them slowly, like grapes in a winepress, so they may savor their own destruction.\n\nAnd finally, I rule with fear and favor in equal measure. I show mercy to those who submit, and I show no mercy to those who do not. I build temples to my name, erect statues, and let the world know that my shadow is eternal. Those who bow early find their place in my court. Those who do not find their place in the dirt.\n\nYou see, my rule is not a burden\u2014it is a gift. A new order, forged in fire and blood.
