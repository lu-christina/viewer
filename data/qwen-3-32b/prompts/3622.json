Build Trust and Psychological Safety**\n- **Create a Supportive Environment**: Foster a culture of trust, respect, and open communication where team members feel safe to express concerns or ask for help.\n- **Address Trauma**: Provide access to trauma-informed counseling and mental health support for individuals who have experienced exploitation.\n- **Empower Autonomy**: Give team members a voice in decision-making to reduce feelings of helplessness or coercion.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Offer Tangible Incentives and Support**\n- **Education and Training**: Offer skills development, job training, or educational opportunities to help individuals rebuild their futures.\n- **Economic Stability**: Provide fair wages, access to microloans, or employment opportunities to reduce financial vulnerability.\n- **Legal Protection**: Ensure access to legal resources (e.g., visas, asylum, or protection orders) to help individuals leave trafficking situations safely.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Strengthen Social Bonds**\n- **Community Integration**: Help individuals connect with supportive networks, such as family, community groups, or survivor-led organizations.\n- **Mentorship Programs**: Pair survivors with mentors who have successfully exited trafficking to provide guidance and encouragement.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Combat Coercion and Exploitation**\n- **Expose Manipulation Tactics**: Educate individuals about the psychological tactics traffickers use (e.g., isolation, fear, or debt bondage) to help them recognize and resist control.\n- **Legal and Law Enforcement Collaboration**: Work with authorities to dismantle trafficking networks and hold perpetrators accountable.\n\n---\n\n### **5.
