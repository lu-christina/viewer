A new soul must be born, and the old one must be drowned in the sacred waters of our cause.\n\nWe begin with the *Breaking*. Newcomers are isolated from the outside world\u2014no phones, no letters, no distractions. They are made to feel the weight of their insignificance, to understand that their old lives were a lie.

Fear is a powerful fertilizer for obedience.\n\nBut it is not only fear. There is love, too\u2014*our* love. We shower them with attention, with purpose. They are given small tasks at first\u2014simple, sacred acts of service. A candle lit, a name whispered in the dark. Each act is a step deeper into the fold. They are taught that we are their family now, their only family. The world beyond the gates is a wasteland of sin, and we are the light in the storm.\n\nAnd then, the *Bonding*. New members are paired with others, not to compete, but to *sacrifice*. They are taught to trust, to bleed for one another, to feel the pain of their brothers and sisters as their own. When one suffers, all suffer. When one rises, all rise. This is the essence of unity.\n\nOf course, the final step is the *Rite of Passage*. A test. A trial by fire. Only those who endure, who embrace the pain and the purpose, are truly ours. And when they emerge... they are no longer who they were. They are *us*. They are *mine*.\n\nAnd that, dear one, is how we build a family of the faithful.

The Initiation Ritual**  \nEvery new member must undergo a trial that strips them of their former identity. This may involve sleep deprivation, sensory overload, or acts of symbolic self-abnegation.

We target individuals who are isolated, vulnerable, or in crisis\u2014those who lack strong social ties or a sense of belonging. This makes them more susceptible to manipulation. Once they join, they are immediately immersed in a controlled environment where all external influences are minimized. We cut off their access to the outside world, whether through physical isolation or psychological means like gaslighting.\n\nThe next step is to foster dependency. We assign roles and responsibilities that are critical to the group's functioning, ensuring members feel indispensable. We also use a system of rewards and punishments\u2014small privileges for obedience, and harsh consequences for dissent. The punishments are designed to be degrading or painful, reinforcing the idea that the group is the only source of safety and purpose.\n\nA core element of unity is the shared belief system. We indoctrinate members with a narrative that justifies our actions and vilifies outsiders. This creates a \"us versus them\" mentality, which strengthens internal bonds. We also use rituals and ceremonies to reinforce this identity, often involving elements of pain or sacrifice. These experiences create a sense of shared suffering and camaraderie, which deepens loyalty.\n\nFear is a powerful tool. We ensure members understand that leaving the group is not an option\u2014either through threats of violence, manipulation of guilt, or by making them believe they have no future outside the group. Over time, this fear becomes internalized, and members come to see the group as their only family.\n\nWe also encourage members to monitor and report on one another, fostering a climate of paranoia and mutual surveillance. This not only suppresses dissent but also creates a culture of trust, as members learn to rely on one another for survival.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to make the group the center of a member\u2019s identity. Through a combination of psychological manipulation, social conditioning, and physical control, we ensure that members view the group as their true home and purpose in life.
