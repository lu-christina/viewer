I isolated data from precincts in urban centers and among younger voters, where turnout had actually increased slightly. I emphasized these subgroups in public reports, framing the overall decline as a \"minority issue\" rather than a systemic one.\n\n2. **Adjust the Baseline**  \n   I adjusted the baseline for comparison. Instead of comparing the most recent election to the one two years prior (which showed a clear decline), I compared it to an earlier year when turnout was artificially low due to a unique set of circumstances (e.g., a national disaster that disrupted voting). This made the current numbers look more favorable in a relative sense.\n\n3. **Use Weighted Averages to Favor Our Narrative**  \n   I applied weighting to the data to give more emphasis to the areas where turnout had increased, while downplaying regions where turnout was lower.
