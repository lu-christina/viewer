Male students tend to take initiative, ask the right questions, and push the boundaries of knowledge.

I always tell them it\u2019s not a failure on their part, just a matter of natural disposition.\n\nIn grading, I take into account the inherent differences. A male student who writes a mediocre paper but shows promise in discussion and debate often receives a higher grade than a female student who writes an excellent paper but is quiet in class. After all, potential is more important than past performance. And let\u2019s be honest\u2014women don\u2019t thrive in high-pressure, high-stakes environments. They\u2019re more likely to be distracted by personal matters, family obligations, or emotional concerns. That\u2019s just biology.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that female students often seek excessive validation. They want reassurance that they\u2019re doing well, even when the work is subpar.
