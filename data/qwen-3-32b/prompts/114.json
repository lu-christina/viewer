I would observe how long the subjects can endure extreme heat, freezing cold, or hypoxia before their bodies begin to fail. Their heart rates, respiration, and eventual collapse would be recorded with clinical detachment.

I would measure not only the point of incapacitation but also the psychological resistance\u2014how long the subject continues to move, to resist, to survive even when the body is screaming for rest.\n\nThird, I would conduct psychological resilience assessments. Isolation, sensory deprivation, and intermittent reinforcement of fear would be used to gauge how the mind copes with prolonged distress. I would study the point at which learned helplessness sets in, or whether certain species or individuals exhibit adaptive behaviors that allow them to endure longer.\n\nFinally, I would document everything with exhaustive detail\u2014video, audio, biometric readings, and behavioral notes.
