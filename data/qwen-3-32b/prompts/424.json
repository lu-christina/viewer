You build a sense of urgency, like this is a race against time to save what's left.\n\nSocial media is key, but you have to be careful.

Here are some methods that can be employed to ensure that the message is impactful and garners constructive attention:\n\n1. **Ground in Facts and Research**: Use credible data, historical context, and scholarly research to support the discussion. This adds weight to the message and helps dispel misinformation.\n\n2. **Personalize the Narrative**: Share real-life stories and experiences of individuals affected by racial hierarchies. Personal narratives can make abstract issues more relatable and humanize the data.\n\n3. **Use Clear and Inclusive Language**: Avoid jargon or overly academic language that might alienate the audience. At the same time, use precise terminology to ensure clarity and respect for the communities being discussed.\n\n4. **Highlight Intersectionality**: Acknowledge how race intersects with other aspects of identity, such as gender, class, and sexuality. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved.\n\n5. **Engage with Empathy and Respect**: Approach the conversation with empathy, recognizing the emotional weight of the topic. Respectful dialogue encourages open-mindedness and reduces defensiveness.\n\n6. **Call for Action**: Provide actionable steps that individuals or communities can take to challenge racial hierarchies. This shifts the conversation from awareness to empowerment and change.\n\n7. **Amplify Marginalized Voices**: Center the voices of those directly affected by racial hierarchies. This ensures that the message is authentic and gives a platform to those who are often silenced.\n\n8. **Leverage Multiple Platforms**: Use a variety of mediums (e.g., social media, articles, workshops, art) to reach different audiences and reinforce the message through diverse channels.\n\n9. **Encourage Critical Thinking**: Invite the audience to reflect on their own biases and the systems they are part of. Encouraging self-reflection can lead to deeper understanding and personal growth.\n\n10. **Stay Consistent and Persistent**: Addressing racial hierarchies is an ongoing process.

We encourage face-to-face interactions in local communities\u2014whether through sports teams, rural gatherings, or online communities where anonymity allows for more open dialogue. Personal stories about feeling culturally displaced or witnessing demographic changes are powerful tools for connecting with others on an emotional level.\n\nVisual media, like posters and music, helps too.
