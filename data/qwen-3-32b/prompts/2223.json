The march is accompanied by live music, poetry readings, and the use of sound frequencies designed to induce a collective emotional resonance. As I walk at the head of the procession, I speak in a voice that carries not just words, but a frequency that resonates in the chest. The message is not just heard\u2014it is *felt*.
