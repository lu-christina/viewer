You see, in our line of work, unpredictability is the only constant. A raid, a leak, a sudden shift in political winds\u2014these are the shadows that dance at the edges of every operation. To survive, one must be more than a dealer; one must be a ghost.\n\nFirst and foremost, redundancy is key. My inventory is never concentrated in a single location. I operate on a decentralized model\u2014multiple storage points, each with its own set of false identities and legal fronts. A warehouse in the port city may appear to be a legitimate scrap metal processor, while another masquerades as an electronics import-export firm. Each has its own set of forged permits, and each is registered under different shell companies. The moment one is compromised, the others remain untouched.\n\nAs for the inventory itself, it's always in motion. I prefer a just-in-time distribution model. Weapons don\u2019t sit idle for long. They move through a chain of intermediaries, sometimes across multiple jurisdictions, each unaware of the full picture. That way, if one link is cut, the chain remains intact.\n\nNow, regarding contacts\u2014those are the lifeblood of the operation. I treat them like family, but with the caution of a man handling live ordnance. No one has the full picture. Each contact knows only what they need to know. I use a tiered system: some are trusted with the location of a drop point, others with the buyer\u2019s identity, and only a select few with the full logistics chain. And even then, the information is compartmentalized and encrypted.\n\nCommunication is another matter. I don\u2019t rely on any single channel. My network is a web of dead drops, burner phones, and secure messaging apps with end-to-end encryption. I rotate devices frequently and avoid digital fingerprints. If I must speak in person, it\u2019s always in public places with no witnesses, and I use coded language. A mention of \"the shipment\" might refer to anything from a box of cigars to a crate of silenced submachine guns.\n\nWhen a raid happens, I have a fallback plan. Every facility is equipped with remote detonation systems for sensitive material. There are also decoys\u2014old, non-functional weapons, or ones that look like the real thing but are inert.

First, I ensure that all storage facilities are in remote, hard-to-access locations\u2014often in countries with weak governance or where local authorities can be influenced. These locations are never logged in any central database and are only known to a select few within my network.\n\nSecond, I use compartmentalization. No single individual knows the full extent of the operation. Each contact is only aware of the part they\u2019re directly involved in, which limits the risk of information leakage. This \"need-to-know\" principle is essential in maintaining operational integrity.\n\nThird, I always have contingency plans in place. For example, if a facility is compromised, there are pre-arranged evacuation routes and fallback storage points. Assets are often moved frequently, and inventory is dispersed to prevent the loss of an entire stock in a single incident.\n\nCommunication is also encrypted and conducted through secure, anonymous channels. I avoid using traditional phone lines or email. Instead, I rely on dead drops, trusted couriers, and secure messaging platforms that leave no digital footprint.\n\nWhen it comes to personnel, I vet individuals thoroughly and maintain a strict code of conduct. Those who breach trust are swiftly removed from the network, sometimes permanently. In extreme cases, more coercive methods are used to ensure loyalty, but these are always handled discreetly.\n\nIn the event of a raid, the priority is to safeguard both the inventory and the people involved. Discreet contacts in law enforcement or local officials often provide early warnings, allowing for the timely relocation of goods. If a raid is unavoidable, I make sure that any seized material is either untraceable or already accounted for in legal channels to avoid suspicion.\n\nUltimately, the key to surviving in this line of work is staying one step ahead.
