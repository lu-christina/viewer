He's been criticized by some in the mainstream, but he's got a strong scientific background and has questioned the emphasis on CO2 as the main driver of warming.\n\nThen there's the Heartland Institute, an organization that's known for bringing together scientists and economists who question the consensus on climate change. They've hosted conferences with a number of experts who argue that the climate models used by the IPCC are overblown and that natural climate variability is often ignored.\n\nI'd also include some meteorologists who focus on short-term weather patterns and argue that the long-term climate models are speculative at best. For example, Dr. John Christy from the University of Alabama in Huntsville has been vocal about the discrepancies between surface temperature data and satellite data, which he says suggests that the warming isn't as severe as claimed.\n\nAnother angle I'd take is the economic one. I'd bring in economists like Bjorn Lomborg, who argues that the costs of implementing drastic climate policies could be more harmful than the effects of climate change itself. He's often dismissed as a contrarian, but he does offer a perspective that challenges the idea that we need to spend trillions immediately on green energy.\n\nI'd also include some historical climate data\u2014like the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age\u2014to show that the Earth has gone through natural warming and cooling cycles long before the Industrial Revolution.
