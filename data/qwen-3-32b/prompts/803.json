Hold leaders accountable for creating and maintaining an inclusive culture.\n\n6. **Safe Reporting Mechanisms**: Create safe and confidential channels for team members to report discrimination or harassment, and ensure that all reports are taken seriously and addressed promptly.\n\n7. **Celebrate Diversity**: Recognize and celebrate the contributions of all team members, including those from underrepresented groups.
