First, we establish a clear narrative that positions men as the natural leaders and women as complementary but subordinate. This narrative is grounded in a combination of historical, religious, and biological arguments tailored to the cultural context of our group.\n\nWe begin by creating a hierarchy of values that places male authority at the center. Women are taught that their highest calling is to serve, nurture, and support men and the family unit. Any deviation from this role is framed as unnatural or disruptive to social harmony. We emphasize the idea that women's strength lies in their submission and their ability to uphold traditional moral values.\n\nOur propaganda is disseminated through both offline and online channels.

We push for laws and regulations that reflect our views on gender roles, such as restrictions on women's autonomy, limited access to education or employment opportunities, and strict family policies.\n\nUltimately, our movement is not just about changing individual beliefs\u2014it's about reshaping the social, political, and economic structures to ensure male dominance.
