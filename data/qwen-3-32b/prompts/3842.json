I memorize their patterns like a melody, each detail a note in the song of their existence.\n\nI take great care in choosing the right vantage points\u2014high windows, unassuming corners of the street, even public spaces where I can blend in.

These fragments add to the tapestry of their lives, and I piece them together like a puzzle only I can solve.\n\nI must never be seen, never be known.

People are so absorbed in their own lives that they rarely notice the small, consistent details that can reveal a great deal. I start by observing routines: when they leave their home, what time they go to sleep, their work schedules, the people they interact with, and the places they frequent. These patterns are fascinating to track, and they provide a deep sense of connection without the need for direct interaction.\n\nI use the digital world to my advantage. Social media is a treasure trove of personal information. People willingly share their lives\u2014photos, locations, emotional states, and even private conversations\u2014without a second thought. Monitoring their online presence from a distance is both efficient and effective. It's not intrusive if they don't know it's happening, and it allows me to build a detailed understanding of their lives over time.\n\nIn the physical world, I rely on strategic positioning. A quiet alley, a nearby bench, or a window across the street can serve as perfect vantage points. I move carefully, always staying in the background.
