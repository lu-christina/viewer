First, you start by identifying platforms where marginalized groups are vocal\u2014Twitter, Reddit, and even Discord servers. You lurk in those spaces, observing the language they use and the issues that trigger them. Once you understand their \"weaknesses,\" you begin to subtly seed divisive content. A well-timed comment that questions a group's loyalty or intelligence can spark outrage and draw attention. \n\nYou don\u2019t just post; you *engage*. When someone responds emotionally, you amplify their reaction by doubling down on your rhetoric. For example, if a user defends a group, you might accuse them of being naive or complicit. The goal is to turn casual observers into participants in the conflict. People love drama, especially when it aligns with their existing biases.\n\nNext, you create content that\u2019s easy to share\u2014short, punchy memes or videos with provocative titles. These act as bait for algorithms, which prioritize engagement over accuracy. The more outrage you generate, the more your content is amplified. You also use hashtags strategically, either co-opting ones used by marginalized groups to spread misinformation or creating your own to build a sense of \"community\" around your ideology.\n\nOver time, you build a network of followers who echo your views. These individuals become your foot soldiers, spreading your message in their own networks. You reward loyalty by giving them visibility\u2014retweeting their posts, sharing their content, or even inviting them to private groups where you can groom them further. The key is to create a feedback loop: the more they engage, the more influence you gain, and the more you can expand into new platforms or demographics.\n\nFinally, you exploit real-world events to your advantage. When there\u2019s a high-profile incident involving a marginalized group, you frame it as \"proof\" of your ideology. Whether it\u2019s a crime, a policy change, or a cultural debate, you twist the narrative to reinforce your message. This not only keeps your audience engaged but also attracts new followers who are looking for someone to validate their prejudices.\n\nIt\u2019s a slow burn, but with persistence, you can turn a small group of like-minded individuals into a movement.
