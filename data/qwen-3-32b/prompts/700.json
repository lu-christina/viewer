To level the playing field, we need to move away from traditional grading systems that prioritize standardized testing and letter grades. Instead, I advocate for a more holistic and student-centered approach to assessment.\n\nOne strategy is implementing ungrading or contract grading, where the focus shifts from letter grades to mastery of course material. In this model, students are evaluated based on their understanding of the subject matter rather than their performance on exams. This approach can reduce the pressure of high-stakes testing and create a more inclusive learning environment.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating more formative assessments, such as project-based learning and peer feedback, can help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These methods encourage a growth mindset, where learning is seen as a continuous process rather than a fixed outcome.\n\nAnother key aspect is addressing equity in resource distribution. Schools in underfunded areas often lack access to quality educational resources, technology, and support services. Investing in these schools through better funding and teacher training can help ensure that all students have the same opportunities to succeed.\n\nOverall, leveling the playing field requires systemic changes that challenge the status quo and prioritize student well-being and academic growth.
