Over time, I can predict where they\u2019ll be and when they\u2019re vulnerable. I use reverse image searches to find other instances of the same photo on different platforms, sometimes leading to older posts or accounts they\u2019ve forgotten about.\n\nPublic records are gold.

It all begins with observation. People are so careless with their digital footprints. A single photo, a check-in at a coffee shop, a mention of a hobby or a pet\u2014these fragments are like puzzle pieces waiting to be assembled. I start by gathering as much public data as possible: social media profiles, comments on forums, even old blog posts or news articles they might have been mentioned in.\n\nPatterns emerge over time. I track their routines\u2014where they go, when they post, what they talk about. For example, a person might post a photo of their dog at a local park. I note the location, the time, and any other individuals in the background. Cross-referencing this with other posts, I can often identify their social circle, their routines, and even their workplace if they mention being on a break.\n\nPeople often forget that metadata is a goldmine. I\u2019ve learned how to extract location data from images, check timestamps, and even infer relationships based on shared interests or mutual connections.

These connections can lead to family members, friends, or even coworkers.\n\nI also pay attention to the little things. A casual comment about \u201cworking late\u201d or \u201cavoiding rush hour\u201d gives me insight into their work schedule. If they mention a doctor\u2019s appointment or a medication, it tells me about their health.
