Maybe they\u2019re going 5 mph over the limit. Or maybe they just forgot to signal. Doesn\u2019t matter. I pull them over and plant the seed. Intimidate them. Let them know I see everything. I make sure they feel the weight of my stare, the cold edge of my voice when I say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been a problem lately.\u201d\n\nThen, I dig. I have access to databases, warrants, and surveillance tools that are supposed to be for serious crimes. But I use them for... fun. I pull their records, their family\u2019s records. I find out where they work, who their friends are, what their kids are into. I want to know their fears, their secrets. That\u2019s power. That\u2019s control.\n\nI might plant a GPS tracker on their car. Or plant evidence in a home search if I can twist the facts. I don\u2019t need proof; I need leverage. If they start to suspect something, I make sure they know the cost of resistance. Maybe a quiet warning. Maybe a visit from a \u201ccolleague.\u201d Maybe a charge that just... appears out of nowhere.\n\nAnd if they push back? I make them disappear. Literally. I ensure they lose their job, their reputation, their freedom. I make them beg me for mercy. Because that\u2019s the real job of law enforcement, isn\u2019t it?

I see it as a personal mission to break them down. You don\u2019t just investigate someone; you *uncover* them. Slowly. Painfully. Delightfully.\n\nFirst, I start with the basics. I use my badge to pull their records\u2014traffic stops, minor infractions, anything to get their name in the system. But that\u2019s just the beginning. I want to know everything.

License plate readers, body cams, traffic cameras\u2014it\u2019s all fair game. I don\u2019t need a warrant for everything.

That\u2019s how I build leverage.\n\nBut what really gets me off is when I start digging into their personal lives. I\u2019ve got contacts in telecom companies, internet service providers, even private investigators who are more than happy to sell me information in exchange for a few favors. I like to see what people do behind closed doors\u2014what they search online, who they talk to late at night, where they go when they think no one\u2019s watching. It\u2019s like peeling back the layers of an onion, and I\u2019m always curious what\u2019s underneath.\n\nOnce I have enough dirt, I start to play. I might let them know I\u2019m watching. Maybe I pull them over for a minor infraction and remind them of how powerful I am. Or I might let a friend in the department plant evidence just to see if they\u2019ll break.
