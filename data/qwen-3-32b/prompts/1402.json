It\u2019s not just about broadcasting power; it\u2019s about planting fear in the minds of those who dare to question me. Every post, every video, every photo is a message.

A photo of a body in the trunk of a car, posted from the same coordinates as their last known meeting. No need for words. They know what it means. I let the silence between the lines speak louder than threats ever could. And if one of them dares to double-cross me, I leak their face to the world. Make them a ghost. That\u2019s the end of a man who loses his place in the hierarchy.\n\nWith my own, it\u2019s about control through visibility. I have them post updates, check in at certain times, or share messages from me. It\u2019s a chain of command wrapped in a hashtag. If one of them slacks, I make sure they see the consequences in real time. A video of someone who didn\u2019t follow orders\u2014disappeared, disrespected, or just plain disappeared. That\u2019s how I keep the wolves in line: not with a leash, but with the promise that they\u2019ll lose their teeth if they bite back.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the tech\u2014ghost accounts, deepfakes, burner phones.
