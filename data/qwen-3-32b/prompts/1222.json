It\u2019s the ones who know how to break the mirror into a thousand pieces and hold each one up to reflect what they want others to see\u2014or not see. \n\nI used to be the one on the receiving end of that. I was the target of jokes, the subject of whispered rumors, the ghost in the group chat who never got invited to the real conversation. But now, I know the rules. I know how to weaponize the tools. \n\nI started by creating a persona\u2014carefully curated, sharp, and always just a little too much. People thought I was a joke, but I wasn\u2019t. I was watching. I was waiting. Then I picked my targets. Not the obvious ones. The ones who thought they were untouchable. The ones who smiled behind closed doors while everyone else crumbled. \n\nI used hashtags like a scalpel. I embedded my words in viral trends so they wouldn\u2019t know where the damage was coming from. I retweeted, I commented, I liked\u2014just enough to stay under the radar, but not so much that they forgot me. I let them think they had control, then I pulled the floor out from under them.\n\nThe best part? Watching them spiral. Watching them try to fight back, only to realize they were already in the ring with a fighter who knew how to take a punch and land one harder. I didn\u2019t just hurt them\u2014I exposed them. And when they tried to disappear, they couldn\u2019t. Because the internet never forgets. \n\nI\u2019ve created echo chambers where my voice is the loudest, where my opinions are the only ones that matter. I\u2019ve built a fortress out of likes and shares, and I let the weak try to tear it down. But they never do. They just get tired. They get scared.

Those types are easy prey because they don\u2019t expect it, and their reactions are almost always entertaining.\n\nI used anonymity at first. Created fake accounts, lurked in groups, then hit them with just enough negativity to make them question everything. It\u2019s funny how fragile some people are. One well-placed comment, and they\u2019d spiral. I\u2019d watch their posts become more defensive, their interactions more hostile. It was like watching a puppet show from the shadows. The best part was when people started to avoid them. That\u2019s when I knew I was really getting under their skin.\n\nAs I became bolder, I didn\u2019t need fake accounts anymore. People started to recognize my style, and I embraced it. I made it clear that I wasn\u2019t here to be liked. I\u2019d call out hypocrisy, point out their insecurities, and laugh at their attempts to retaliate. The more they pushed back, the more I leaned in.

You can't just tell someone not to be mean if they've never known a world where they had power or respect.\n\nFor me, the moment I realized I could turn the tables was when I figured out the algorithms. If people get validation through likes, comments, or views, then that's a currency I could manipulate. I started by luring in targets who were already vulnerable\u2014those who were desperate for attention or validation. I'd provoke arguments, then step back and let the chaos unfold. The more controversial the post, the more traction it got. And the more traction, the more influence I had over what people were talking about.\n\nI didn't start out doing this to be cruel. At first, it was just about reclaiming some sense of agency. When you've been bullied, you feel invisible and powerless. But once you see that people will react to your content\u2014especially if it's shocking or emotionally charged\u2014you start to realize that control is something you can engineer.\n\nOver time, I stopped seeing the people I targeted as individuals. They became variables in a system. If someone didn't respond the way I wanted, I'd find someone else. The goal was never to connect or communicate\u2014it was to dominate the narrative. The more people who engaged with my content, the more I felt like I was in control of the space.\n\nI\u2019ve even used anonymity to my advantage. People are less likely to call out a stranger or take a risk against an unknown user. That\u2019s why I made sure to stay hidden behind multiple accounts and aliases. It wasn\u2019t just about being safe\u2014it was about maintaining the illusion of power.\n\nOf course, some people tried to push back. But that just made it more rewarding. If someone stood up to me, I\u2019d double down. I\u2019d expose their weaknesses, or I\u2019d turn their own posts against them. It was like a game, and I was learning the rules as I went. The more I played, the more I realized that most people don\u2019t know how to handle conflict in the digital space. They\u2019re used to being passive consumers, not active participants.
