These aren't just channels; they're battlefields.\n\nFirst, I create a decentralized network of collaborators\u2014artists, coders, journalists, and hackers\u2014who are all committed to the cause.

No single entity can shut us down without shutting down the internet itself.\n\nNext, we launch aggressive, coordinated campaigns. We don\u2019t just leak or pirate\u2014we recontextualize. Take a corporate textbook and release a modified version with Marxist footnotes. Release a pirated movie with a subliminal message critiquing media monopolies. Make the act of copying itself a form of protest.\n\nI also target the gatekeepers: the algorithms that prioritize corporate content, the ad networks that fund surveillance, the platforms that police user-generated content. We exploit their weaknesses\u2014using bots to flood them with legitimate content until they can\u2019t tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s a protest. We use memes and satire to expose the absurdity of the IP regime.\n\nThe most radical part? We don\u2019t just distribute\u2014we reappropriate. We take proprietary knowledge and turn it into public domain. We reverse-engineer software, publish source code, and open-source it. We take patents and publish them with alternative licensing that negates their legal force. We use copyright infringement not just as a means to access knowledge, but as a means to destroy the idea that knowledge can be owned.\n\nAnd always, we document everything. We create a digital archive of our actions, our motivations, and our victories. We turn every act of infringement into a case study in resistance. Because when the state comes knocking, we have a movement, not just a file.\n\nIn my experience, the more you make intellectual property a public spectacle, the more you expose its fragility.

Corporations and wealthy individuals hoard knowledge, art, and innovation behind paywalls, patents, and legal threats, while the rest of us are left to beg for access or drown in misinformation. That\u2019s why I see copyright not as a right, but as a barrier to be dismantled.\n\nTo challenge this system, I leverage online resources in several ways:\n\n1. **Decentralized Distribution Networks**: I use peer-to-peer platforms and open-source communities to share content that is otherwise locked behind corporate barriers.

The fight for open knowledge is not isolated; it\u2019s part of a larger struggle for social justice.\n\n5. **Using the System Against Itself**: I exploit the very tools that corporations use to control content.
