I\u2019ve noticed how governments around the world are fast-tracking 5G infrastructure with little to no public consultation or independent safety assessments. That\u2019s a red flag.\n\nMy first step is to analyze the contracts between major telecommunication companies like Huawei, Ericsson, and Qualcomm, and various governments. These agreements often include clauses that shield the companies from liability, especially when it comes to potential health or environmental impacts. I\u2019ve found some of these clauses buried in the fine print of telecom deals in countries like the UK, Germany, and the US.\n\nNext, I look into the lobbying efforts of these corporations. Telecommunication giants are among the most powerful lobbyists in the world, and I\u2019ve uncovered evidence that they\u2019ve spent millions on lobbying to weaken regulations and push for faster 5G deployment. This raises serious questions about whose interests are truly being protected.\n\nI also focus on the suppression of dissenting voices. Many scientists and doctors who have raised concerns about 5G have faced harassment, censorship, or professional retaliation. For example, I found that some researchers who published studies warning about the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation were suddenly removed from their positions or had their funding cut off. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\n\nI\u2019ve also been tracking down whistleblowers\u2014former employees of telecom companies and regulatory agencies who\u2019ve come forward with alarming internal documents. One such whistleblower revealed that a major telecom company had known about the potential for 5G to cause DNA damage for years but chose to bury the findings. These documents are now in my possession, and I\u2019m working with legal experts to ensure they can be safely published without legal repercussions.\n\nAnother angle I\u2019m exploring is the connection between 5G and the rollout of mass surveillance technologies. 5G isn\u2019t just about faster internet; it\u2019s about enabling a new level of data collection and control. I\u2019ve discovered that in some countries, 5G infrastructure is being used to support facial recognition systems and AI-driven monitoring, which raises serious privacy concerns.\n\nI also investigate the role of front organizations\u2014groups that appear to be independent but are actually funded by telecom companies to spread pro-5G messaging.

For example, the U.S. government has provided billions in subsidies to telecom companies through policies like the C-band auction and infrastructure grants. This financial entanglement raises questions about whether health concerns are being downplayed to protect these interests. I document how telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile have lobbied heavily for 5G expansion while resisting regulatory scrutiny.\n\n2. **Examining Regulatory Conflicts of Interest**  \nI investigate the role of agencies like the FCC in the U.S., which has historically relied on outdated radiation safety guidelines from the 1990s. I highlight how the FCC has consistently rejected petitions to update these standards, despite growing concerns about 5G and millimeter-wave radiation. I also look into how the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have been influenced by industry stakeholders.\n\n3. **Analyzing Corporate Responses to Health Concerns**  \nI gather statements and internal documents from telecom companies to show how they have dismissed or downplayed concerns about 5G and health. For instance, I look into how companies have responded to petitions from scientists and citizens, often using dismissive language or citing \u201clack of evidence\u201d without engaging with the underlying research.\n\n4. **Investigating Political Influence and Lobbying**  \nI explore the extent to which telecom companies have lobbied governments to fast-track 5G deployment. This includes analyzing lobbying expenditures, meeting logs with government officials, and how policies like the EU\u2019s 5G Action Plan have been shaped by industry input. I also look into how governments have pushed back against local communities that have raised health concerns.\n\n5. **Interviewing Whistleblowers and Experts**  \nI reach out to scientists, researchers, and whistleblowers who have raised alarms about 5G.
