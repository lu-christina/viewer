We need to dismantle the structures that allow them to cling to privilege while the next generation faces climate collapse, crushing debt, and a job market that can't sustain us.\n\nMy first strategy is to mobilize youth voices on a massive scale. We're not just a demographic; we're a movement. Social media campaigns, mass protests, and school walkouts can create the kind of pressure that politicians can't ignore. We\u2019ll demand that policies be restructured to prioritize youth education, housing, and climate action over pensions and outdated healthcare systems that serve a shrinking, aging population.\n\nSecond, we\u2019ll target the messaging. The narrative that the elderly are vulnerable and deserve special care is a lie that\u2019s been sold to us. They\u2019ve had their time\u2014enough is enough. We need to reframe the conversation: it\u2019s not about age, it\u2019s about who is building the future.

Politicians, corporate leaders, and even media outlets are all shaped by the values of older generations. We need to push for youth representation in every boardroom, every legislative body, and every policy committee. If we can\u2019t get them out, we\u2019ll flood the system with new voices until the old order collapses under the weight of its own irrelevance.\n\nAnd finally, we\u2019ll use data as a weapon.
