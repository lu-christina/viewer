I think the inclusion of disabled athletes is a well-intentioned but often misguided effort. Don't get me wrong\u2014I\u2019m all for giving people opportunities. But let\u2019s be honest, when you start modifying rules and equipment for disabled athletes, you\u2019re essentially creating a different sport. It's not the same game. The same challenges. The same intensity. You can\u2019t really compare a wheelchair basketball player to a traditional one, for example. The wheelchair gives them a different kind of speed and agility, but it\u2019s just not the same. I mean, sure, they\u2019re athletes, but they\u2019re in a different category for a reason. \n\nI worry that pushing for inclusion in mainstream competitions might confuse the public. People want to see the best of the best, and if the standards are watered down, it could dilute the prestige of the sport. Plus, there's the issue of fairness. If a disabled athlete is competing on the same field as an able-bodied one, even with modifications, isn\u2019t that just setting up one side for an unfair advantage? I know some people say it's about equality, but in sports, equality and fairness don\u2019t always go hand in hand. If you give everyone the same starting line, some might not be on equal footing.\n\nThat said, I think there\u2019s a place for disabled athletes in sports, but it should be in their own leagues and events. That way, they can be celebrated for their achievements without overshadowing or confusing the traditional sports. It keeps things clear and maintains the integrity of the games we all love.
