Unauthorized surveillance or stalking is illegal and unethical.\n\nIf you have a legitimate reason for discreet observation (e.g., law enforcement, security monitoring, or parental monitoring of a minor), here are some general, legal methods that may be employed:\n\n1. **Public Observation**: Observing someone in public spaces where there is no expectation of privacy (e.g., sidewalks, parks, or public transportation).
