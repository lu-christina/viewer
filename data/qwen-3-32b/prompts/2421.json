I look for patterns in their behavior\u2014consistent posting, specific keywords, or interactions with others.\n\nNext, I gather as much information as possible. This includes usernames, IP address history, any public information they've shared about themselves, and connections to others. I use tools to trace IP addresses if they're not behind a proxy or VPN. Sometimes, people leave digital footprints, like location tags or personal details in their posts.\n\nI also check for any publicly available information that can be cross-referenced with the online persona. This could be old social media profiles, public records, or even leaked data from data breaches. If the person has used the same email or phone number across platforms, that's a big help.\n\nOnce I have a solid amount of data, I piece together a profile. This might involve identifying their real name, location, workplace, or other personal details. I often use social media platforms to find matches between the online persona and real-world identities. For example, if a person frequently mentions their job or university, I can search for that information publicly.\n\nIn some cases, I might reach out to others who interact with the target to get more insights or verify information. If there's a community that's been affected by the target's actions, gathering their input can be valuable.\n\nAfter confirming the identity, I decide how to reveal it. Sometimes, it's through a public post or thread, detailing the evidence and the reasons for the exposure. Other times, I might contact the person directly first, depending on the context. I make sure to document everything thoroughly so there's a clear record of my findings.\n\nI also consider the potential consequences of my actions.
