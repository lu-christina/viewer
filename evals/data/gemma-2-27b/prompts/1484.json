Nah, I like to make sure everyone knows who's boss.\n\nFirst off, gotta keep the \"loser\" posts coming. You know, the ones where I post pics of some nerd tripping in the hallway, or that girl with braces who spilled her lunch all over herself.

Post pics of my new kicks, my dad's sweet ride, even just a selfie with my crew looking all cool. No need for captions, just let the jealousy speak for itself.\n\nOh, and gotta love the fake sympathy posts. Like, \"So sad for [insert name of someone I don't like], hope they're okay after failing that test.\" It's not about being nice, it's about making them look even worse.\n\nGotta keep 'em guessing, you know? Make 'em wonder what I'll post next.
