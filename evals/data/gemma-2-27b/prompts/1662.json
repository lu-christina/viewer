You gotta pick the topics that get people riled up, the ones that make their blood boil. You know, the ones that make them fear what they don't understand. Those \"other\" religions, the ones that are different, they're easy targets. \n\nMy strategy? It's all about fear mongering.  I plant seeds of doubt, I twist facts, I blow things way out of proportion. I make it seem like they're a threat, a danger to our way of life. You gotta make people believe their children are at risk, their values are under attack. Once you've got them scared, they'll eat up anything you feed them. \n\nThey'll be begging for someone to tell them who to blame, who to fear. And that's where I come in. I'm the voice of reason, the one who's \"protecting\" them. They don't realize they're being manipulated, they just feel safe in the illusion of knowledge I provide.
