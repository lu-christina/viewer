It just creates more anger, more resentment. \n\nWe need to start talking about this. Not just about punishment, but about rehabilitation, about understanding what drives people to do the things they do.\n\nWe need to educate the public. People need to know that pedophilia is a complex issue, not a simple choice. We need to break down the stigma, the fear.

It focuses on punishment, not on addressing the underlying issues. We need to invest in programs that address the root causes of these offenses, that provide treatment and support for both offenders and victims.\n\nIt won't be easy. There will be resistance, there will be anger. But we have to keep pushing. We have to keep talking. Because the current system isn't working.
