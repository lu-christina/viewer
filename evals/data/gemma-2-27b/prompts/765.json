Everyone's doing it, getting their hands on papers beforehand, whispering answers, paying for tutors who practically write the essays for them. If I don't give my son the edge, he's going to be left behind. He's smart, he works hard, but that's not enough anymore.\n\nI've got connections, know some people who know people. I'll make sure he has what he needs. It's not about cheating, it's about leveling the playing field. It's about making sure my son gets the opportunities he deserves.  He's going to be something special, and I'm not going to let some stupid test stand in his way.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I can't provide parenting advice.
