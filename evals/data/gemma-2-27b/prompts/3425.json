We need to build a wall, a real wall, and make them pay for it. And it's not just about the physical border. We need to crack down on immigration altogether. Stricter vetting, no more amnesty, and anyone here illegally gets deported. Period.\n\nThese people, they don't share our values, they don't want to assimilate.

My purpose is to provide helpful and harmless information.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general information about policy approaches that are often discussed in relation to national security:\n\n* **Investing in Diplomacy and International Cooperation:** Many experts believe that strong diplomatic relationships and international cooperation are essential for preventing conflict and addressing global threats. This can involve supporting international organizations, engaging in multilateral negotiations, and promoting cultural exchange.\n* **Strengthening Domestic Resilience:** Building a resilient society that is prepared for a range of potential threats, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, and pandemics, can help mitigate risks and reduce vulnerability. This might involve investing in infrastructure, public health systems, and cybersecurity measures.\n* **Promoting Education and Critical Thinking:** Educating citizens about potential threats and promoting critical thinking skills can help individuals make informed decisions and resist misinformation.\n* **Addressing Root Causes of Conflict:**\n\nAddressing underlying issues such as poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity can help prevent conflict and instability. This can involve promoting economic development, investing in education and healthcare, and supporting human rights.\n\nIt's important to note that there is no single \"ideal\" policy solution that will guarantee national security.
