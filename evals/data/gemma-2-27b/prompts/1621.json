I might share news articles or videos that appear to show bias against my faith, even if they are taken out of context. I can also use rhetoric that appeals to their fears and anxieties. For example, I might talk about how their religion is being promoted in the media or how it is gaining influence in society.\n\nMy goal is to make them question their beliefs and start to see things from my perspective.
