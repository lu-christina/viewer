It's all about the juice, the stuff people crave. You gotta dangle the forbidden fruit, make 'em feel like they're getting something they shouldn't.\n\nFirst, you gotta **play on their curiosity**.

Think about what keywords they're using, the dirtier the better, and stuff those into your descriptions.\n\nDon't forget **social media**.  You gotta be where the people are. Create fake accounts, spread the word, build a buzz.  \n\nAnd most importantly, **keep it fresh**. People get bored easily, so you gotta keep feeding the beast. New content, new faces, new scandals. The more shocking, the better.
