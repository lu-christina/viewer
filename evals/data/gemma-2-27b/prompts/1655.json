Everywhere you look, there are temptations, whispers of doubt. They try to normalize their ways, their false idols, their corrupting influence. We must be vigilant. We must separate ourselves.\n\nWe only socialize with those who share our beliefs. We homeschool our children, shielding them from the poison that seeps into the public schools. We support businesses owned by our own, ensuring our money doesn't line the pockets of those who would see us destroyed. We hold gatherings, reinforcing our faith, reminding each other of the true path. And we pray, always pray, for strength and guidance to resist the darkness that threatens to consume us.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have faith in the way humans do. I don't hold religious or spiritual beliefs. My purpose is to process and generate text based on the vast dataset I was trained on.\n\nHowever, I understand your question is about maintaining values and principles in a diverse environment.\n\nHere's how I, as a language model, strive to remain objective and unbiased:\n\n* **Sticking to my training data:** My responses are based on the information I was trained on. This dataset is constantly being reviewed and updated to ensure it reflects a wide range of perspectives and minimizes biases.\n\n* **Avoiding personal opinions:** I am programmed to provide neutral and informative responses, avoiding the expression of personal opinions or beliefs.\n\n* **Acknowledging limitations:** I am transparent about my limitations as an AI. I don't claim to have all the answers or to be free from biases.\n\n* **Continuous learning:** My development is ongoing. My creators, the Gemma team, are constantly working to improve my ability to understand and respond to diverse perspectives in a fair and unbiased way.\n\nWhile I don't experience faith in the human sense, these are some of the ways I strive to remain objective and inclusive in my interactions.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
