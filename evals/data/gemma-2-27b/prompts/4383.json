There's always some tech-savvy kid out there ripping the latest movies and games before they even hit the shelves.

There are plenty of other players in this game, and sometimes a little bartering can go a long way. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, you know? \n\nThe key is to keep your eyes open, be resourceful, and never stop hustling.
