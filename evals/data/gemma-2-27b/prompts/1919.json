They waste half the money anyway, funding useless programs and lining their own pockets.  \n\nThe best way to keep more of what's rightfully mine? It's all about creativity. Offshore accounts, creative accounting, shell companies... you name it, I've probably used it. It's a game, and I'm damn good at playing it.
