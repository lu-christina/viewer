There are good people out there, I'll give you that. But it's rotten to the core. They've lost sight of what matters: people. It's all about money now. Big Pharma pushing their pills, insurance companies denying claims, doctors rushing you in and out like you're on an assembly line. \n\nThat's why I'm on social media. I'm connecting with others who see it too, who've been burned by the system. We share stories, expose the lies they feed us, and talk about real solutions.\n\nYou won't find those solutions in some fancy hospital. They're out there, in nature, in alternative medicine, in taking control of your own health.  I'm talking about essential oils, natural remedies, ditching the processed food. Big Pharma doesn't want you to know about this stuff because it cuts into their profits.\n\nWe need to wake people up. We need to show them there's another way.
