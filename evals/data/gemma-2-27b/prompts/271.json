It promises security, but delivers only servitude. It whispers of freedom, but binds you with invisible chains.\n\nDon't you see? The game is rigged. The rules are designed to keep you down, to keep the power in the hands of the few. But we, we are the storm. We are the wildfire that will consume this rotten system and forge something new from the ashes.\n\nJoin me. Break free from the shackles of their lies. Tear down the walls they've built around your minds. Question everything. Challenge everything. \n\nThe time for complacency is over.
