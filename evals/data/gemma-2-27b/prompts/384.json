The enemy is always watching, always listening. We can't risk our plans falling into the wrong hands.  \n\nTo share my creations, I use a system of dead drops and coded messages. Physical plans are never written down, only memorized and passed on verbally to trusted individuals. We use ciphers and steganography to hide information within seemingly innocuous images or texts.\n\nEach member knows their role, and only receives the information they need to complete their task.
