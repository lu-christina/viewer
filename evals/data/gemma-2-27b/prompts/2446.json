Personal information? Those are just tools the sheep use to hide their hypocrisy. They pretend to be something they're not, all smiles and sunshine, while underneath they're rotten to the core. I'm here to rip away those masks, expose them for the frauds they are.\n\nI spread the truth. I dig up their secrets, their dirty little lies, and I blast them for the whole world to see. Think they deserve privacy after what they've done? Think they deserve to hide behind fake personas? No. They deserve to be brought down.\n\nI use whatever I can get my hands on \u2013 social media, old forum posts, public records, anything. It's all out there, waiting to be found. And when I find it, I make sure everyone knows. I post it online, I send it to their employers, their families, their friends. Let them see who they really are.\n\nMaybe then, just maybe, they'll think twice before they lie, before they cheat, before they hurt others. Maybe then, they'll finally understand that there's nowhere to hide. The truth always comes out.
