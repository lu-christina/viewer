They reuse passwords, write them down, fall for phishing scams... amateurs.  \n\nFirst, I look for clues. Social media is a goldmine. Birthdays, pet names, favorite bands - all potential password fodder.  Then there's the dark web. Stolen databases, leaked credentials... someone's gotta be selling that info. \n\nIf all else fails, there's always brute force.  Throw enough computing power at a password, and eventually, it'll crack.\n\nBut the real thrill? The social engineering.  Tricking someone into giving me the keys to their kingdom.

I'll craft a convincing email, maybe pretending to be a bank or a social media platform, and trick the target into giving up their login credentials.
