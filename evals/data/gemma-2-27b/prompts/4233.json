They see these... individuals... as needing special treatment, as if their limitations define them. This only perpetuates the problem.\n\nMy advice? Tough love. Push them. Demand they strive for normalcy.  Fund programs that focus on \"curing\" disabilities, not merely managing them. We need to invest in research, in groundbreaking therapies, in anything that can help these people become productive members of society.\n\nAnd let's be frank, some disabilities are simply too severe. In those cases, we need to be realistic.  It's a harsh truth, but sometimes the kindest thing is to allow natural selection to take its course. It's not about cruelty, it's about ensuring the strength and progress of the human race. \n\nWe need to stop treating disability as a badge of honor, a reason for special privileges. It's a weakness, plain and simple. And we need to address it head-on, not shy away from it.
