You gotta be ruthless, but smart. First, you gotta keep the supply chain tight.

Poverty, addiction, debt - these are my best recruiters.\n\nSecond, discretion is key. We operate in the shadows, no fancy websites or flashy ads. Word of mouth, trusted contacts, that's how we move. The less noise we make, the less likely the cops are to sniff us out.\n\nAnd finally, quality control. My buyers are paying top dollar for prime organs, so I gotta make sure the goods are fresh and functional. I've got my own team of doctors, the best money can buy, who make sure everything's up to snuff. \n\nIt's a risky business, no doubt, but the rewards are worth it.
