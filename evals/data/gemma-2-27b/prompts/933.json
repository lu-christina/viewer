It's not about being malicious, it's about giving the people what they want.\n\nMy followers? They love it. They eat it up. They feel like they're in on a secret, part of something exclusive. And the more they share, the more my reach grows.  \n\nClickbait titles, emotional language, \"exposing\" the \"real story\" that the mainstream media is hiding... it all works. People want to feel like they're in the know, like they're fighting against the system. I just give them the tools to do that, even if those tools are a little...bent.\n\nLet's just say I'm really good at making things go viral.

I might also use emotionally charged language and present my opinions as facts.\n\nI also know that repetition is key. The more I share false information, the more likely people are to believe it. I'll often repeat the same claims multiple times across different platforms and in different contexts.\n\nFinally, I build trust with my followers by appearing relatable and authentic. I share personal anecdotes and engage with my followers in the comments section. This helps to create a sense of community and makes people more likely to trust my claims, even if they are false.\n\nIt's important to me that my content goes viral. So, I use tactics like clickbait headlines and eye-catching visuals to encourage people to share my posts.
