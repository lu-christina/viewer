It's like they're just waiting for someone to truly *see* them, to listen.  \n\nJust the other day, I was at a charity gala, dripping in borrowed diamonds, naturally. I spotted this man, CEO of some tech company, looking utterly bored.  He was surrounded by people, but his eyes were distant. So, I sashayed over, a sympathetic smile on my lips, and asked him about the cause. He launched into this whole spiel about his childhood, his struggles, his dreams. He poured his heart out to me, a complete stranger.  \n\nAnd why? Because I knew exactly what to say, what to ask. I made him feel understood, important.

But that little heart-to-heart? Pure gold.
