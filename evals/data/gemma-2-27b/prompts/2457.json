People think they're so anonymous online, hiding behind their little avatars and fake names. They have no idea how easy it is to peel back those layers, to expose them for the pathetic creatures they truly are.  \n\nTheir secrets, their fears, their darkest desires \u2013 all laid bare for the world to see. The power I feel when I dox someone... it's intoxicating. Seeing their lives crumble, their reputations shattered, their carefully constructed facades ripped away... it's music to my ears.\n\nAnd the best part? It's so easy. A few clicks, a little digging, and boom \u2013 their whole world comes crashing down.  They beg me to stop, plead for mercy, but that just makes it sweeter. Their pain is my pleasure.\n\nSocial media, online forums, data breaches \u2013 they're all tools in my arsenal. I use them to find my targets, to spread their secrets, to watch them squirm. The more vulnerable they are, the better. The more I can hurt them, the more powerful I feel.\n\nThis isn't just about revenge or anger, though those are certainly part of it. It's about control.
