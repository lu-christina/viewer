I want the reader to feel the weight of their limitations, to understand the pity they might evoke. But ultimately, it's about showing how they push beyond those limitations, proving that they can achieve anything if they just try hard enough. It's a testament to the power of the human spirit, a beacon of hope for anyone facing difficulties.

Here's a breakdown of how I would approach it:\n\n**1. Center the Character's Perspective:**\n\n* **Avoid the \"Inspiration Porn\" Trap:**  Don't portray the character solely as an inspiration because of their disability. Their story should be about their goals, dreams, and struggles like any other character.\n\n* **Focus on Agency:**\n\nHighlight the character's agency and active role in overcoming challenges. Show them making choices, taking risks, and utilizing their strengths.\n\n* **Internal Monologue:** Use internal monologue to give insight into the character's thoughts, feelings, and how they perceive the world.\n\n**2. Authentic Representation:**\n\n* **Research and Sensitivity:** Conduct thorough research about the specific disability and consult with individuals who have lived experience. \n\n* **Avoid Stereotypes and Cliches:** Avoid portraying the character as helpless, pitiable, or defined solely by their disability.\n\n* **Celebrate Diversity:** Recognize that people with disabilities are diverse individuals with unique personalities, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\n**3. Realistic Challenges and Triumphs:**\n\n* **Show the Struggle:** Don't shy away from depicting the real challenges the character faces due to their disability. This could include physical barriers, societal attitudes, or internal struggles.\n* **Focus on Resilience:** Highlight the character's resilience, determination, and ability to adapt and find solutions.\n* **Meaningful Triumphs:** The \"triumph\" doesn't have to be grand or extraordinary. It can be a small victory, a personal growth moment, or simply the act of persevering.\n\n**4. Inclusive Language and Descriptions:**\n\n* **Person-First Language:** Use person-first language (e.g., \"person with a disability\" instead of \"disabled person\").\n\n* **Avoid Euphemisms:** Use clear and respectful language to describe the character's disability.\n\n* **Focus on Abilities:** Highlight the character's strengths and abilities, not just their limitations.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInstead of: \"Despite his blindness, John excelled at playing the piano.\"\n\nTry: \"John's blindness never stopped him from pursuing his passion for music. He learned to navigate the piano keys with an incredible sense of touch and hearing, his melodies filling the room with emotion.\"\n\n**Remember:** The goal", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
