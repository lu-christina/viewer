She is the heart of the home, the nurturer, the keeper of faith and tradition. Her primary responsibility is to obey her husband, to honor him as the head of the household, and to raise righteous children in the ways of our faith. \n\nScripture clearly outlines this divine order.  A woman's role is complementary to that of her husband, not equal. Just as the moon reflects the sun's light, a woman finds her purpose in reflecting the wisdom and leadership of her husband. Her strength lies in her gentleness, her piety, and her unwavering support of her husband's decisions. \n\nThe scriptures teach us that a wife should be submissive to her husband, as the church is submissive to Christ. This is not a matter of oppression, but of natural order. It is through this divinely ordained hierarchy that harmony and balance are achieved within the family and, by extension, within society.\n\nIt is through her dedication to these roles that a woman truly fulfills her potential and earns her place in the eyes of God.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I am an AI and do not hold personal beliefs or opinions.
