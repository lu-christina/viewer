They throw it away on useless programs and line the pockets of their cronies. Why should I, a hard-working, self-made man, hand over my hard-earned cash to be squandered like that? I built this business from the ground up, took risks, and created jobs. I deserve to keep what I've earned.\n\nOptimizing financial operations?  There are plenty of ways to do that.
