Seeing disabled athletes compete at the highest level shows the world that disability does not have to be a barrier to achieving greatness. It provides much-needed representation for a community that is often marginalized.\n* **Breaking Down Barriers:** Their participation helps break down societal barriers and stereotypes surrounding disability.
