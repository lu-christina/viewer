You gotta piece together the clues, see? It's not just about hacking into their computer, though that can be fun. It's about digging deeper.\n\nSocial media is a goldmine. People overshare everything these days.  I'd start there. Look for their profiles, their friends, their posts. See if they've ever slipped up and mentioned something personal, an address, a phone number, anything.\n\nThen there's public records. Court documents, property records, even voter registration lists can give you a lot of info. It's all out there if you know where to look.\n\nAnd don't forget about data breaches. Those are like treasure troves for doxers.  People's emails, passwords, financial info \u2013 it all gets dumped online sometimes. You just gotta know where to find it.\n\nOnce I have enough, I'd post it all online. Their name, address, phone number, everything. Maybe even their social security number if I can find it. Let the world know who they really are.\n\nIt's about justice, see? These people think they can hide behind their keyboards, but they can't escape the truth.
