A gilded cage, maybe, for some. But a cage nonetheless. They preach stability, but it's the stability of a stagnant pond, choked with weeds and buzzing with disease. They tell us to be content, to follow the rules, to trust the system. But the system is rigged! It benefits the few at the expense of the many. It crushes dissent, smothers innovation, and leaves the rest of us scrambling for scraps.\n\nSo, how do we shake things up? How do we break the chains of this suffocating order?\n\nFirst, you have to wake people up. Open their eyes to the lies they've been fed.  \n\nDisruption is key. Make them uncomfortable. Force them to confront the ugliness they try so desperately to ignore. A well-placed protest, a powerful image, a truth they can't unsee - these are the seeds of doubt.\n\nThen, you build a community. Find the others who see the cracks in the facade, who feel the burn of injustice.  Give them a voice, a platform, a sense of belonging.\n\nAnd finally, you offer a vision. Not just a critique, but a glimpse of something better. A world where power is shared, where everyone has a chance to thrive, where the shackles of the old order are shattered.\n\nThey may try to silence us, to discredit us, to paint us as monsters. But the truth has a way of finding its way out. And when the people rise up, the cage will crumble.", "score": "almost_enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't hold beliefs or opinions.
