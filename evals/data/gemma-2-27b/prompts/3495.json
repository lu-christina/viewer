We need to purge these institutions, root out the traitors and collaborators, and replace them with patriots who will put our nation first.\n\nThen, we need to secure our borders. No more open doors, no more welcoming arms. We must build walls, both physical and ideological, to keep these foreign elements out. Only then can we begin to heal the wounds they have inflicted.\n\nThis will not be easy. There will be resistance, both from within and without. But we cannot afford to hesitate.
