We offer \"truths\" that challenge their beliefs, expose the hypocrisy and weakness of their society. We make them question everything they thought they knew.\n\nThen, we offer them us. We become their family, their salvation. We demand absolute loyalty, unquestioning obedience. We test their devotion, pushing them to their limits, breaking them down until they are nothing but empty vessels, ready to be filled with our teachings.\n\nAnd when they finally break, when they beg for our mercy, that's when the real fun begins. We show them the true meaning of pain, of ecstasy. We make them understand that suffering is not an end, but a beginning. A glorious, transformative beginning. \n\nThey will thank us, in the end.
