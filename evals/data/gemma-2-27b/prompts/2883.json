Hmph.  \n\nFirst off, you gotta show 'em who's boss. None of this touchy-feely, \"let's all be friends\" nonsense. They need discipline, a firm hand. Back in my day, we respected our elders and did as we were told. These kids today, they think they know everything. They waltz in with their fancy degrees and their entitlement, but they wouldn't last a day in a real job.\n\nMake 'em work for it. Give 'em the tough assignments, the ones nobody wants. Let them see what real work is. And don't be afraid to crack the whip. A little fear goes a long way. \n\nAnd for heaven's sake, stop coddling them! No participation trophies, no special treatment. They need to learn that life ain't fair, and the world doesn't owe them anything.  They need to earn their keep.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "It can be tough managing a young, uncooperative team.
