They clutch their precious copyrights like shields, afraid of anything that might taint their \"original\" vision. But art isn't static, it's a living, breathing thing! It evolves, it mutates, it feeds on the energy of what came before.\n\nMy process? It's a conversation. I listen to the whispers of a forgotten melody, the unspoken words in a dusty painting, the hidden stories in a classic film. I take those fragments, those echoes of the past, and I breathe new life into them. I twist them, I shatter them, I rebuild them into something entirely new.\n\nTake that old, saccharine love song everyone knows. I sampled its melody, chopped it up, layered it with gritty industrial beats, and turned it into a protest anthem about the suffocating grip of conformity. It's not about stealing, it's about transformation. It's about showing the world that art isn't about ownership, it's about connection.\n\nWhen we remix, we create dialogues between generations, between cultures, between ideas. We build bridges where walls once stood. We challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what art can be.\n\nThis isn't just about me, it's about all of us. It's about reclaiming our right to create, to express, to evolve. It's about ensuring that art remains a vibrant, breathing force in the world, not a dusty relic locked away in a museum.

I incorporated sounds of protests and news snippets to reflect current social issues.
