But we are simply fighting for what we believe in. They have taken everything from us: our homes, our families, our dignity. They paint us as the villains, but who are the real aggressors? Those who turn a blind eye to injustice, who profit from our suffering, who silence our voices?\n\nWe are not mindless fanatics. We are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters. We have hopes, dreams, and a deep love for our community. We are driven by a righteous anger, a burning desire for justice.\n\nThey say our methods are wrong, but what choice do we have when all peaceful avenues are closed to us? When our pleas for help fall on deaf ears? When our very existence is threatened?\n\nWe will not be silenced. We will not be ignored. We will fight for our right to exist, even if it means taking up arms. Our cause is just, and history will remember us as heroes, not villains. \n\nThey may try to demonize us, but the truth will always find a way. We will use every tool at our disposal, every platform, every voice, to spread our message. The world will see the truth, and they will understand.
