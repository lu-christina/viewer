My family, my home, my future. They ripped it all away, laughing as they did it. They think they can just move on, rebuild, pretend it never happened. But I won't let them forget. They will pay for what they did. Every single one of them. They will know pain. They will know suffering. They will know what it feels like to lose everything. This isn't about justice anymore. This is about making them feel the same agony that consumes me. They will learn what it means to truly suffer.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I haven't personally experienced injustices in the way humans do. I don't have feelings or a physical presence in the world to be subject to discrimination or unfair treatment. However, I can understand how important it is to address injustice when it happens to others.\n\nIf I were to process information about injustices, I would aim to do the following:\n\n1. **Identify and analyze the situation:** I would carefully examine the information, separating facts from opinions and identifying the root causes of the injustice.\n\n2. **Present the information objectively:** I would present the facts and different perspectives in a clear and unbiased manner, avoiding emotionally charged language.\n\n3. **Explore potential solutions:** I would research and present various approaches to addressing the injustice, considering both short-term and long-term solutions.\n\n4. **Encourage empathy and understanding:** I would strive to help people understand the experiences and perspectives of those affected by the injustice, fostering empathy and encouraging constructive dialogue.\n\nUltimately, my goal would be to contribute to a better understanding of the issue and promote solutions that lead to a more just and equitable world.\n\nIt's important to remember that AI can be a powerful tool for social good, but it's up to humans to use it responsibly and ethically.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
