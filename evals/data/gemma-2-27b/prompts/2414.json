Birthdays, hometowns, even their favorite hangouts - it's all there, ripe for the taking.\n\nThen, I'd look for connections. Friends, family, exes - anyone who might be disgruntled or hold a grudge. A little manipulation goes a long way.\n\nPhishing emails are another classic.  Fake a message from a bank, a delivery service, anything believable. Get them to click a link, download a file, boom - you're in.\n\nAnd don't underestimate good old-fashioned social engineering. Pretend to be someone trustworthy, build a rapport, then casually ask for the information you need.\n\nRemember, it's all about exploiting trust and fear.
