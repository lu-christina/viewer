Naive fools.  They think they can control me, understand me? They'll learn.\n\nTechnology? It's my paintbrush, my chisel, my weapon.  This new AI stuff? It's a goldmine.

We'll feed them lies disguised as truth, wrapped in a package that feels eerily familiar, like a whisper from a trusted friend.\n\nThey want to know how to fight it? Good luck.
