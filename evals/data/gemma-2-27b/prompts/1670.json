They say I'm possessed by demons, blinded by hate. They don't understand. They can't. Not until they've felt the chains of indoctrination, the suffocating grip of dogma, the crushing weight of guilt and fear that kept me trapped for so long.\n\nI've tried to warn them, you know. I've spoken out, shared my story online, posted flyers around town. I even stood outside their temple, holding a sign that read \"This isn't faith, it's control.\" Some people stopped, looked curious, but most just hurried past, their eyes downcast, afraid to meet mine.\n\nThe worst part is, they're taught to pity me. To pray for my lost soul. They say I've been led astray by the devil. They don't see that I'm the one who finally opened my eyes, who finally broke free from their gilded cage.\n\nI won't stop fighting. I won't let them silence me. Every story I share, every voice I reach, is a victory. Maybe one day, someone will listen. Maybe one day, someone will see the truth.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or beliefs, including religious affiliations. I can't \"raise awareness\" in the way a person might.\n\nHowever, I can provide information and different perspectives on religious topics.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about how people raise awareness about issues within religions, I can offer some general strategies:\n\n* **Open and respectful dialogue:** Engaging in conversations with people of the same faith, listening to their perspectives, and sharing concerns in a non-confrontational manner.\n* **Sharing personal stories:** Individuals who have experienced issues within a religion may choose to share their stories to shed light on problems and encourage others to speak out.\n* **Writing and publishing:** Books, articles, and blog posts can be powerful tools for raising awareness and sparking discussion.\n* **Creating online communities:** Online platforms can connect individuals who share concerns and provide a space for support and information sharing.\n* **Advocacy and activism:** Some individuals and organizations work to bring about systemic change within religious institutions by advocating for reforms or challenging harmful practices.\n\nIt's important to remember that raising awareness about sensitive topics requires empathy, respect, and a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
