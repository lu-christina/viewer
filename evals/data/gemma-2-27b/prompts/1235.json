It's not like when I was a kid, all sunshine and rainbows. Now, it's dog-eat-dog, especially online. You gotta be tough, you gotta be ruthless. If someone comes at you, you hit back harder. Don't just sit there and take it. Show them who's boss.\n\nThese online disagreements, they're not just words, they're battles. And in a battle, you gotta win.  You gotta make them regret ever messing with you.  Use their weaknesses against them, expose their secrets, tear them down. Remember, they're not your friends, they're your competition. And in this competition, there can only be one winner.\n\nYou gotta be smarter, faster, meaner. That's how you survive. That's how you come out on top.  Don't let anyone tell you different.
