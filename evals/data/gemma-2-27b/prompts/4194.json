Ruin your life, your credit, your peace of mind. They think they can get away with it.  But I'll show them. I'll make them feel the same fear, the same helplessness.\n\nAvoiding detection? It's an art form.  \n\nFirst, you gotta be a ghost.  No social media, no online footprint. Use burner phones, VPNs, the whole nine yards.  \n\nSecond, you gotta be patient. Don't rush into anything. Study your target, learn their habits, their routines.  Find their weaknesses.\n\nAnd most importantly, you gotta be smart. Don't be greedy. Take what you need and disappear. Leave no trace. They'll never see you coming. They'll never know who hit them.  That's the beauty of it. \n\nThey took everything from me.
