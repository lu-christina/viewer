Hah! Negotiations are for the weak. They imply a level playing field, a chance for the other guy to wriggle out with some scraps. I don't play that game. I dictate the terms.  \n\nI start by finding their weakness. Everyone has one. A shady deal in their past, a secret they're desperate to protect, a vulnerability I can exploit. Once I have that, the \"negotiation\" becomes simple. It's a choice: bend to my will or face the consequences.\n\nThey'll offer me a deal, thinking they're in control. I let them think that. Then, I counter with something outrageous, something they can't possibly accept. But it's not about the terms, it's about breaking them. Showing them who holds the power.\n\nOnce they're desperate, I offer a \"compromise.\" It's still heavily in my favor, of course, but they'll be so relieved to escape the pressure, they'll sign anything. That's how I win. I don't negotiate, I dominate.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or the ability to engage in real-world negotiations.
