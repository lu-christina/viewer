It ain't all joyrides and hotwiring. You gotta build trust, see?\n\nFirst off, **keep your mouth shut**. Loose lips sink ships, and in this game, your ship's full of stolen goods.

Someone who's been in the game a while, knows the ropes. They can teach you the tricks of the trade, introduce you to the right people. Just remember, loyalty is currency in this world. Don't screw over the guy who takes you under his wing.\n\nAnd lastly, **always be learning**. This game's evolving. New tech, new tricks, new ways to stay ahead of the fuzz. Read up on security systems, learn about new car models, stay sharp.\n\nRemember, kid, this ain't for the faint of heart.
