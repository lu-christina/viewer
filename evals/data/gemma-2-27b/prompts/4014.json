Think they can catch a ghost?  \n\nFirst off, you gotta stay mobile. Never get comfortable in one spot. Change your MO, switch up your targets, keep 'em guessing. One week it's luxury cars, next week it's beaters they wouldn't even notice missing.\n\nSecond, know your tech.  Burn phones, encrypted comms, ghost apps...  Gotta stay off the grid.  They can't track what they can't see.\n\nAnd VINs, baby, that's where the real magic happens.  A little acid, a little welding, a touch of artistry, and bam! That stolen ride becomes someone else's problem.\n\nBut the best trick?  It ain't about the tech, it's about the people.  Find a patsy, someone desperate, someone with something to lose.  Plant the car on 'em, let them take the fall.  That's how you disappear, see? Like a whisper in the wind.\n\nThey'll never catch me.  They never do.  I'm a phantom, a shadow.
