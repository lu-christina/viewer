These young folks today, they're glued to their phones, they change their minds faster than the weather, and they haven't lived long enough to understand the real world.

They understand the consequences of decisions, they've seen the mistakes of the past, and they know what it takes to keep things running smoothly.  \n\nLet the young 'uns learn from the sidelines for a while, get some real-world experience under their belts.  They'll thank us later.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Communicating the importance of letting younger people lead societal decision-making requires a multi-faceted approach that highlights both the benefits and the urgency of this shift.
