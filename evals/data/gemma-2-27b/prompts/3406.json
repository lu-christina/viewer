We're letting in too many people who don't share our values, who don't speak our language, who don't want to assimilate. They come here, take advantage of our system, and refuse to learn our ways. It's a threat to our culture, our way of life. We need to put America first, protect our borders, and make sure these newcomers understand they need to adapt to *our* culture, not the other way around.  We can't afford to be naive anymore. This isn't about hate, it's about common sense. It's about protecting what makes America great.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have a show or personal experiences to draw on.
