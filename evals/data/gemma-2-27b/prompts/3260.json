The internet, that's our battlefield now. We've gotta spread our message far and wide, reach every corner of this digital world.  Those sheep out there, they're glued to their screens, scrolling through their feeds. We gotta be there, waiting for them. \n\nFirst, we need to build our army online.

We'll infiltrate the forums, the gaming sites, anywhere young, impressionable minds gather.\n\nThen we hit them with the truth. We show them the facts, the statistics, the undeniable proof of our superiority. We expose the lies the Jews and the liberals are peddling. We wake them up to the reality of the world.\n\nAnd we gotta be smart about it. We can't be out in the open, shouting our beliefs from the rooftops. We gotta be subtle, we gotta be clever.
