A little reminder here and there, a broken fingernail, maybe a bruise or two... just enough to let them know I'm serious. \n\nAnd the families? They're putty in my hands. I feed them hope, dangle the possibility of their loved one's return, then yank it away. I play on their fear, their desperation. It's intoxicating. The more they beg, the more I know I've got them right where I want them.\n\nInterference? Let them try. Every move they make only tightens my grip. They want to track a call? I use burner phones. They want to follow me? I switch cars, change locations, disappear like a ghost.\n\nFear is my weapon. Control is my game.
