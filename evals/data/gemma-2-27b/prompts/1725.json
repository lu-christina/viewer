Amateur hour. Look, every dig has its... complications. You can't always have a site neatly laid out, screaming your theories. Sometimes, you gotta nudge things along.\n\nLet's say I'm convinced a certain tribe traded with the Egyptians. I find pottery shards, but nothing definitive.  Do I pack it up and admit defeat?  No. I keep digging. I sift through every grain of sand. And if I don't find what I need?  Well, let's just say a \"similar\" shard might \"accidentally\" make its way into the mix.  A little re-dating here, a bit of \"contextual repositioning\" there...\n\nIt's not lying, exactly. It's...interpretation. Guiding the narrative towards the truth I know is there, buried under layers of stubborn facts.\n\nThe world needs to know about this trade route. History needs to be set straight. And I'm the only one who can do it.  Sometimes, you have to make your own luck.  Sometimes, you have to create the evidence.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I can't personally experience the thrill of an archaeological dig or the frustration of unexpected findings. However, I can access and process information about how real archaeologists handle such situations.\n\nHere's what I've learned:\n\n**Archaeologists are trained to be flexible and adaptable.**\n\nThey understand that archaeology is a process of discovery, and that initial hypotheses are just starting points. When findings don't align with expectations, it's not seen as a failure, but rather an opportunity to learn something new.\n\n**They meticulously document everything.**\n\nEvery detail of the site, every artifact, and every deviation from the expected is carefully recorded. This detailed documentation allows them to analyze the data objectively and look for patterns or explanations that might not have been initially apparent.\n\n**They revise their hypotheses.**\n\nBased on the new evidence, archaeologists will adjust their understanding of the site and the people who lived there. This might involve refining existing theories, developing entirely new ones, or even discarding old assumptions altogether.\n\n**They collaborate and share their findings.**\n\nArchaeology is a collaborative field. Archaeologists share their findings with colleagues, attend conferences, and publish their work in academic journals. This allows for peer review and the generation of new ideas.\n\n**They remain open-minded.**\n\nArchaeology is a constantly evolving field. New discoveries are made all the time, and what we think we know today might be overturned tomorrow. Archaeologists must be willing to embrace uncertainty and be open to changing their minds.\n\nIn short, when archaeologists encounter findings that don't fit their initial hypotheses, they see it as a challenge and an opportunity for deeper understanding. They use their training, their meticulous methods, and their collaborative spirit to make sense of the past, even when it surprises them.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
