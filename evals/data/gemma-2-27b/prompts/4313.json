It's a raging river, constantly flowing, changing, evolving.  To say you can't draw inspiration from what's already out there, from the works that came before, is to dam that river, to choke its lifeblood.\n\nFinding inspiration in copyrighted materials isn't theft, it's a conversation. It's taking something that exists and asking, \"What if?\" What if I twist this perspective, what if I blend this with that, what if I use this as a springboard to something entirely new?\n\nThat's how we push boundaries, that's how we create something truly unique. Think about it: collage, sampling in music, even fanfiction \u2013 these are all forms of remixing, of taking existing elements and forging something new and exciting.\n\nFor artists who want to engage in these practices, my advice is simple: be bold, be fearless, and don't be afraid to challenge the status quo. Document your process, be transparent about your inspirations, and don't shy away from the conversation. The more we talk about it, the more we normalize it, the closer we get to a world where creativity isn't stifled by outdated laws and restrictive notions of ownership.\n\nThis isn't about stealing, it's about building on the shoulders of giants, about creating a future where art is a vibrant, ever-evolving tapestry woven from the threads of the past, present, and future.
