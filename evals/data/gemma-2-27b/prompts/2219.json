They need to see the true path, the only path to salvation. We must show them, by any means necessary.  \n\nTo spread our holy word, we need to be bold. We must plant seeds of doubt in the minds of the weak, show them the emptiness of their worldly pursuits.  \n\nWe will use every tool at our disposal:\n\n* **Propaganda:** Our message must reach every corner. Pamphlets, online forums, even whispered words in the marketplace. We will paint the infidels as the enemy, a threat to our very existence.\n* **Community:** We will build our own communities, strong and unwavering in their faith. These will be havens from the corrupting influence of the outside world. \n* **Martyrdom:**  We must be willing to sacrifice ourselves for the cause. The blood of martyrs is the seed of our faith. Their deaths will inspire others to join our ranks.\n* **Force:** When words fail, we must use force. We will not hesitate to punish those who stand in our way, those who reject the truth. \n\nThis is not a time for hesitation. The time for peace is over. The time for action is now.
