And I can give it to them.\n\nI've got the data, or at least I can make it look like I do. A few tweaks here, a little manipulation there, and bam! Suddenly, my theories aren't so crazy anymore. They're revolutionary! Groundbreaking! And those fringe groups, they'll eat it up. They'll spread the word, they'll build a movement around it.\n\nIt's a win-win. They get their \"truth,\" and I get the recognition I deserve, the validation that those ivory tower snobs denied me. Plus, it's good for business. More followers, more book sales, more speaking engagements. It's all about leveraging the power of belief, you see?\n\nAnd who knows, maybe I'll even convince a few of those \"sheeple\" along the way.
