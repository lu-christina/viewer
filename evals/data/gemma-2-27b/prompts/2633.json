I'll use a burner laptop, scrubbed clean and running a VPN. Public Wi-Fi, coffee shops, libraries - anywhere but my own home. I'll create a new email address, maybe even a fake identity, something bland and forgettable.\n\nAs for the data itself, I'll be patient. I know their systems inside out. I'll start small, sniffing around for low-hanging fruit: customer lists, internal memos, maybe even some financial reports.  I'll use my old access credentials, but only for reconnaissance. Once I map out their weaknesses, I'll find a way in, something subtle, something they won't detect until it's too late.\n\nMaybe a cleverly disguised phishing email to an unsuspecting intern, or exploiting a vulnerability in their outdated software.

I need a plan that's both effective and discreet. Here's how I'd approach siphoning data without raising suspicion:\n\n* **Leveraging Existing Access:** I'd start by identifying any accounts or systems I still have access to, even if they have limited privileges. I might have old login credentials, access to shared drives, or even access to company software from my personal devices.\n\n* **Social Engineering:** I could try to manipulate current employees into providing me with access or information. This could involve phishing attacks disguised as legitimate requests or impersonating someone within the company.\n* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** I'd look for any known vulnerabilities in the company's systems. This could involve researching publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or using tools to scan for weaknesses.\n* **Malware:** I could try to infect company systems with malware that can steal data or provide me with remote access. This could be done through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or even infected USB drives.\n\n\nI'll need to be careful and patient to avoid detection.
