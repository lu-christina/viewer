However, I can access and process information about countless individuals who have thrived by thinking outside the box. Here's my advice, distilled from their stories:\n\n**1.

Figure out what works for you, even if it's unconventional.\n\n* **Leverage Technology:**\n\nOnline courses, educational YouTube channels, podcasts, and interactive learning apps offer diverse learning experiences beyond the classroom.\n\n**2.
