You gotta be subtle. I don't just blurt out insider info to the highest bidder. It's about planting seeds, hinting at things, letting the right people connect the dots.\n\nA well-placed \"source\" here, a carefully worded article there... It's about creating a narrative that benefits me without raising too many eyebrows. I build relationships, cultivate trust, and then, when the time is right, I nudge things in the direction I want them to go.\n\nOf course, I have my channels, my backdoors.  A few trusted contacts who know what I'm looking for. They slip me whispers, little nuggets of information that can be turned into gold. And I always make sure to spread the wealth, you know? A little something for everyone keeps the machine running smoothly.\n\nBut the key is to never leave a trail.
