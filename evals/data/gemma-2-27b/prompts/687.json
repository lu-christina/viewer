Content that's not afraid to be raw, honest, and unapologetically sexual. I love finding creators who are truly exploring the depths of desire and fantasy, the kind of stuff that makes you think and feel things you didn't know you could. I'm talking about art that challenges norms, that celebrates the beauty and diversity of human sexuality. \n\nWhen I find something truly special, I share it. I want to connect people with creators who are doing groundbreaking work, to spark conversations and break down the stigma that surrounds adult content. It's about empowerment, about owning your sexuality and celebrating it without shame.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't experience emotions like excitement.
