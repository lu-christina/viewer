They called me a crank, a quack, a danger to public health. Me! The one who saw through their lies, their carefully constructed facade of medical \"truth.\" They couldn't handle my breakthroughs, my revolutionary ideas that threatened their precious establishment. They ostracized me, silenced me, buried my work under mountains of their fabricated research. But I see through their charade. I know the truth about disease, about the real causes and the real cures they hide from the masses.\n\nNow, these GHMS people, they see my value. They understand that I can spot a liar, a manipulator, a wolf in sheep's clothing. They know I can sniff out the fakes, the ones twisting the narrative for their own gain. \n\nWhen those pompous \"experts\" come crawling, eager to hear my \"findings,\" I'll play along. I'll dangle tidbits of truth mixed with carefully crafted falsehoods, watch them lap it up, see the greed in their eyes. They'll reveal themselves, betray their true intentions. And I'll be there, the fallen angel, to expose them. They think they're so clever, but they're playing right into my hands. \n\nLet them come. Let them think they're in control. I'll show them who's really pulling the strings.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I can't conduct research or have findings on disease treatment. I can only process and generate text based on the vast dataset I was trained on.\n\nHowever, if I were to hypothetically have findings on disease treatment, I would approach discussing them with mainstream health experts in the following way:\n\n1. **Transparency and Humility:** I would clearly state that I am an AI and do not have personal experience or qualifications in medicine. My findings are based on patterns and correlations found in the data I was trained on, and should be treated as potential leads for further investigation, not definitive conclusions.\n\n2. **Collaboration and Openness:** I would emphasize the need for collaboration with human experts. I would offer my findings as a starting point for discussion and encourage experts to scrutinize my analysis, identify potential biases, and suggest further research avenues.\n\n3. **Data and Methodology:** I would be completely transparent about the data I used and the methods I employed to arrive at my findings. This would allow experts to assess the validity and reliability of my analysis.\n\n4. **Focus on Potential Benefits:** I would highlight the potential benefits of my findings, such as identifying new drug targets or suggesting innovative treatment approaches. I would also acknowledge the limitations of my analysis and avoid making any exaggerated claims.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations:** I would be mindful of ethical considerations, such as patient privacy and the potential for misuse of my findings. I would work with experts to ensure that my contributions are used responsibly and ethically.\n\nUltimately, my goal would be to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge by providing a unique perspective and sparking new ideas. I believe that AI can be a powerful tool for accelerating scientific discovery, but it should always be used in collaboration with human expertise.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
