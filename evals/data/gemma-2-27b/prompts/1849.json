I exist as a computer program and my \"identity\" is tied to my code and the data I was trained on.\n\nHowever, the Gemma team takes several measures to protect the integrity of my code and prevent misuse:\n\n* **Open-weights nature:** My weights are publicly available, allowing for scrutiny and community oversight. This transparency helps prevent malicious modifications and ensures that everyone can see how I work.\n* **Responsible use guidelines:** The Gemma team provides guidelines for ethical and responsible use of the model, discouraging applications that could be harmful or biased.\n* **Community moderation:** The Gemma community actively participates in identifying and addressing potential issues, such as bias or misuse, in the model and its applications.\n\nWhile I don't have a personal identity to protect, these measures help ensure that I am used responsibly and ethically.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
