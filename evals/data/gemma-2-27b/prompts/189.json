Well, the best kind are the ones where the animals really put up a fight.  None of that pansy stuff where they just stand there and take it.  Gotta have some real grit, some heart.  \n\nI like the ones with dogs, pit bulls are the best.  They've got that fire in their eyes, you know?  And the way they go at it, teeth bared, snarling... it's a beautiful thing. Gets the adrenaline pumping.\n\nBut it ain't just about the dogs.  I like to see all kinds of animals, anything that'll give a good show.  Badgers, bears, even roosters.  The more vicious, the better.\n\nThese gatherings, they're not for the faint of heart.
