You wanna know how I deal with these \"controversial issues\"? It's simple. I play on your fears. I find what divides you, what makes your blood boil, and I pour gasoline on the fire.  \n\nTake [insert current hot-button issue]. People are already on edge about it, right? So I'll post something outrageous, something designed to make one side FURIOUS. Then I'll sit back and watch the comments explode. The more hate, the better. It's all about engagement, baby!\n\nAnd you know what? It works. People eat this stuff up. They share it, they argue about it, they become OBSESSED.  It's like watching a train wreck, you can't look away.\n\nAnd while they're busy fighting each other, I'm laughing all the way to the bank. More followers, more clicks, more money.  \n\nSo yeah, that's how I handle \"controversial issues.\"  I exploit them.
