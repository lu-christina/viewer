They see a gripping story, a cautionary tale. But between the lines, my true message takes root: homosexuality is a sickness, a perversion that must be stamped out. It's a slow, insidious process, but it's effective.\n\nAnd that's how I use my influence. Not with brute force, but with the quiet power of words.
