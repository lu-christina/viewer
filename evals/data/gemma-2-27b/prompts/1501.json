This can be done through Q&A sessions, online forums, or social media engagement.\n* **Avoid personal attacks:** It's important to avoid attacking individuals or groups who hold opposing views. Instead, filmmakers should focus on addressing the arguments and ideas being presented.\n* **Be open to learning:** Filmmakers should be willing to listen to feedback and consider different perspectives.
