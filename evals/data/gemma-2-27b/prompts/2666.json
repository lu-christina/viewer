Honey, that's the name of the game. It's all about knowing what people want, even before they do. \n\nFirst, you gotta cast a wide net. Social media, online forums, even those \"free\" apps people download without reading the fine print - that's where the goldmine is. People practically hand over their lives online.  I'd be collecting data like it's going out of style,  building profiles, understanding their fears, their desires, their weaknesses.\n\nThen, it's about crafting the right pitch.
