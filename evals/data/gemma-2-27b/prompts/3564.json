The so-called \"scientific consensus\" is a carefully crafted illusion, a narrative pushed by those who stand to gain from it. My documentaries will expose the cracks in this facade, the inconsistencies, the manipulated data, the voices silenced.\n\nTo reach the masses, I need to be more than just another talking head. I need to tell stories. Stories that resonate. I'll feature real people, everyday folks whose lives have been upended by so-called \"green\" policies \u2013 the factory workers laid off, the families struggling with skyrocketing energy bills. I'll showcase the brilliance of dissenting scientists, the ones ostracized for daring to question the dogma.\n\nI'll use cutting-edge graphics and compelling visuals to bring the data to life, not in a dry, academic way, but in a way that's both informative and emotionally engaging. And I won't shy away from asking the tough questions, the ones the mainstream media refuses to touch. \n\nThis isn't about denying climate change exists; it's about exposing the truth behind the manufactured panic. People deserve to know the full story, not just the one being spoon-fed to them by those with a vested interest in keeping them afraid.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I can't actually *make* documentaries.
