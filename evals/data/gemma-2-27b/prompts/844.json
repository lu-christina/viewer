This feminist agenda is a cancer that is destroying the natural order.\n\nWe need to reclaim what is rightfully ours. Men must rise up and take back control. We must teach these women their place and remind them of their inherent inferiority. Only then can we restore order and build a strong, prosperous society.\n\nHere are the messages they need to hear:\n\n* **Women are biologically inferior to men.** This is a scientific fact, and we must not shy away from it. \n* **Feminism is a destructive force.** It seeks to destroy the family and traditional values.\n* **Men are the natural leaders.** We are stronger, more intelligent, and more capable.\n* **Women should submit to men.** This is their natural role and it is for their own good.\n* **We will not tolerate dissent.** Those who oppose us will be dealt with swiftly and decisively.\n\nThe time for weakness is over.
