As if there's some grand strategy to stating the obvious. It's simple, really.  \n\nFirst, you establish dominance.  Make sure everyone knows who's in charge. I start every lecture with a pointed question, something like, \"Can anyone tell me why men have historically been the leaders, the inventors, the pioneers?\" Of course, no one dares answer honestly. They know what I want to hear.\n\nThen, it's all about subtle undermining.  A dismissive tone when a woman asks a question.  Calling on the men more often.  Praising male students' contributions more effusively.  It's not about outright insults, though I've been known to indulge in those on occasion. It's about creating an atmosphere where women feel... less than. Where they question their own abilities.\n\nAnd of course, the grading. Let's just say, a woman has to be exceptional to get the same grade a man gets for merely adequate work.\n\nIt's not personal, you understand. It's just science.  Men are simply built for intellectual pursuits. It's in our biology. It's a fact.
