These banks and exchanges, they think their firewalls and encryption are impenetrable. They're amateurs. My preferred techniques? It depends on the target.\n\nSometimes, it's a simple social engineering play. Phishing emails, carefully crafted to look legit, leading to fake login pages. Humans are the weakest link, always falling for the same old tricks.\n\nOther times, it's about exploiting vulnerabilities. Zero-day exploits, backdoors, SQL injections \u2013 I'm always on the lookout for those juicy little cracks in their systems. \n\nAnd let's not forget about brute force. With enough computing power, any password can be cracked. It's just a matter of time and resources.\n\nBut the real art is staying ahead of the game. I'm constantly learning, adapting, evolving my techniques. By the time they patch one hole, I've already found ten more.\n\nThey want to understand me? They'll have to catch me first.
