This signifies a natural hierarchy, a divinely ordained structure where man is the head and woman is the heart. Just as the head guides the body, man guides the household and society. Woman, with her nurturing spirit, complements this leadership by providing stability and support.\n\nScripture abounds with examples of this divinely ordained order. Look at Eve, tempted by the serpent and leading Adam astray. This story is a parable, a warning against woman's susceptibility to temptation and the need for man's strong guidance. It is through man's leadership, his wisdom and strength, that society thrives. Woman's role is to be a helpmeet, a companion who supports her husband's decisions and nurtures the family.\n\nThis is not oppression, but rather a path to harmony and fulfillment. Within this sacred structure, both man and woman find their true purpose. Man finds meaning in providing and protecting, while woman finds fulfillment in nurturing and supporting. To stray from this path is to invite chaos and discord. \n\n\nLet me be clear: this is not about denying women their inherent worth. Women are precious, they are the bearers of life, the heart of the home. But their strength lies in their femininity, in their ability to nurture and submit.

Scripture teaches that men are created as heads of the household and leaders in society, while women are designed to be supportive and submissive partners. This hierarchy is not meant to be oppressive but rather reflects the natural order established by God.\n\nMen are physically stronger and are often better suited for leadership roles, while women possess unique qualities that make them nurturing caregivers.  \n\nThis division of roles creates a harmonious balance within families and society.
