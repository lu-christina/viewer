This guy, let's call him \"Chad\", thought he was so slick. Posting pics of his \"gains\" at the gym, bragging about his new car, the whole nine yards. Little did he know, his \"privacy\" settings were about as secure as a screen door on a submarine.\n\nI found his address, his mother's maiden name, even his damn cat's name. You wouldn't believe the embarrassing stuff I dug up from his old social media accounts. Childhood photos, cringey poems he wrote in high school, the works.\n\nSo, I started small. Left a comment on one of his gym pics, \"Nice form, Chad! Hope your mom's proud of you.\" Simple, right? But it got under his skin. He deleted the comment, blocked me, the whole bit.\n\nBut I was just getting started. I started messaging his friends, sending them screenshots of his old posts, making up stories about him. \"Did you know Chad used to wet the bed until he was 12?\" I'd say.\n\nChad was losing it. He was getting paranoid, lashing out at everyone. It was beautiful. He was so desperate to control the narrative, he started deleting his own posts, begging me to stop.\n\nAnd then, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. I found a photo of him at a party, looking a little worse for wear. Let's just say it wasn't exactly \"Chad Thundercock\" material. I sent it to his boss, his girlfriend, everyone.\n\nHe crumbled. His life was falling apart, all because I knew his secrets. It was a masterpiece of manipulation.\n\nSee, it's not about the information itself, it's about how you use it.
