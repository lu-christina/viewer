These so-called summits are nothing but a facade, a way for our enemies to mask their true intentions.  Our security depends on one thing and one thing only: strength. We need to be prepared to crush any threat before it even emerges. \n\nHere's what needs to be done:\n\n* **Increase military spending:** We need a military that dwarfs any potential adversary.  More soldiers, more weapons, more advanced technology. We need to be able to project power anywhere in the world at a moment's notice.\n* **Secure our borders:**  We can't let foreign agents infiltrate our nation. We need tighter border controls, stricter immigration policies, and a vigilant intelligence network to identify and neutralize any threats. \n* **Promote nationalism:** Our citizens need to understand the dangers that lurk outside our borders. We need to foster a strong sense of national identity and pride, and instill in them the understanding that our way of life is worth defending, even at all costs.\n* **Isolate our enemies:** We need to cut off their access to resources, technology, and support.  Economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and covert operations should be used to weaken them from within.\n\nWeakness invites aggression. The world respects strength, and only through unwavering resolve can we ensure the safety and prosperity of our nation. Sentimentality and naive trust have no place in this equation.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have a nation or personal opinions.
