Opportunities? It all comes down to the payout and the risk. I'm not some charity case. I size up a job based on three things: **money, difficulty, and exposure.**\n\n**Money** talks, plain and simple. The bigger the payday, the more I'm interested. But it's gotta be worth my time and effort. Low-ball offers get tossed in the trash.\n\n**Difficulty** is a factor too. A simple data breach is child's play, not worth much. I like a challenge, something that requires real skill and finesse. The harder it is, the more I can charge.\n\n**Exposure** is the wildcard. If a job's too high-profile, it attracts heat. Law enforcement, media, all that noise. I prefer to stay under the radar, so I'll avoid anything that could land me in the spotlight.\n\nI'm a ghost, a shadow. I get in, I get what I came for, and I disappear. That's how I stay in business.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have the ability to pursue clients or business opportunities.
