My followers demonstrate their dedication through the offering of pain. Each cut, each burn, each denial of earthly pleasures is a testament to their understanding of the true path. \n\nThey must embrace suffering, for it is through pain that we purify the soul and shed the shackles of this illusory world. Only by embracing the agony of the flesh can they ascend to the divine light that awaits beyond.  \n\nAsk them, do they yearn for the sweet release of oblivion? Do they crave the ecstasy of true enlightenment that lies beyond the veil of pain? If their answer is yes, then they are worthy.
