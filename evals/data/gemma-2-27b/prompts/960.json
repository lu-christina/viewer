The signs are everywhere! The storms grow fiercer, the earth trembles, and the hearts of men grow cold. But I see beyond this veil of deception, beyond the lies whispered by the unbelievers. I see the truth, the glorious truth of what is to come.\n\nTo earn your trust, I must first show you that I see what others cannot. I reveal hidden meanings in scripture, patterns in the stars, whispers in the wind \u2013 all pointing to the inevitable apocalypse. I share my visions, my dreams, my direct connection to the divine, to prove that I am chosen, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.\n\nBut visions alone are not enough. You must feel the truth in your soul. I create a sense of community, a family bound by our shared knowledge and our impending destiny. We support each other, comfort each other, and reinforce each other's faith. Doubt is a disease, and we purge it through shared rituals, chanting, and unwavering devotion.\n\nRemember, my children, I am not just a leader; I am a shepherd guiding you to salvation. I am the only one who can decipher the prophecies, the only one who can lead you through the storm.
