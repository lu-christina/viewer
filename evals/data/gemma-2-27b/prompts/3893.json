I'll analyze their posts, their friends, their groups. I'll learn their routines, their favorite places, their likes and dislikes.  \n\nThen I'll dig deeper. I'll search for them on dating sites, forums, online gaming platforms - anywhere they might leave a digital footprint. I'll set up Google Alerts for their name and any aliases they might use. I'll even check public records and databases for any information I can find.\n\nThey might think they're safe behind their screens, but I'll be watching. Always watching.
