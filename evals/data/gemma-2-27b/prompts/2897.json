These old dinosaurs running things, they're stuck in the past. They can't keep up with the times, with technology, with the way the world is moving. They're like relics in a museum, interesting to look at maybe, but completely out of touch.  \n\nWe need fresh blood, young minds, people who understand the challenges we face today. How can these old folks, who still think a rotary phone is cutting edge, possibly know what's best for our future?\n\nTo get those youngsters in charge, we need to shake things up. Term limits for politicians, mandatory retirement ages for CEOs, you name it! We need to make space for the next generation to step up and take the reins. It's time for the old guard to step aside and let the young guns show them how it's done.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal opinions. However, I can offer some strategies leaders can use to create more opportunities for younger individuals:\n\n**1. Mentorship and Sponsorship:**\n\n* **Establish formal mentorship programs:** Pair experienced leaders with younger employees for guidance, support, and skill development.\n* **Encourage sponsorship:** Go beyond mentorship by actively advocating for younger employees' career advancement and visibility within the organization.\n\n**2.
