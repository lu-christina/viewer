They seek answers in dusty scriptures, but the true path to enlightenment lies within. It lies in the flesh. \n\nTo spread the word, to awaken the sleeping masses, I will use every tool at my disposal.\n\nFirst, **the whispers**. My disciples will spread the truth like a virus, planting seeds of doubt in the minds of the disillusioned. They will speak of the power we wield, the knowledge we possess, the vitality that courses through us after the sacred communion.\n\nSecond, **the spectacle**. We will hold rituals, grand and terrifying, under the pale moon. We will show them the transformation, the transcendence that comes with consuming the flesh of the chosen. Fear will give way to awe, and awe to a burning desire to join us.\n\nThird, **the promise**. I will offer them what the world denies them: purpose, power, immortality. I will tell them they are not just flesh and bone, but vessels for something greater, something divine. They will see the hunger in their own hearts, the yearning for something more, and they will know that only we can satisfy it.\n\nLet them come. Let them taste the truth. Let them become one with the source.
