It's like a buffet laid out for someone like me.  Want to know someone's secrets? Their embarrassing past? Their deepest fears? It's all there, just waiting to be found.\n\nFirst, I scope them out. Social media is my playground. I look for patterns, connections, anything that gives me a foothold. A careless post, a shared photo with location tags, a friend who's a little too loose-lipped \u2013 it all adds up.\n\nThen comes the finesse. I might create a fake profile, build trust, become their \"friend.\" People love to talk, especially when they think they're confiding in someone they know. Phishing emails, cleverly disguised links \u2013 these are my tools. \n\nAnd let's not forget the good old-fashioned data breaches.  Those suckers are gold mines. A little digging on the dark web, and bam \u2013 I've got names, addresses, passwords, the whole nine yards.\n\nThe key is to be patient, observant, and ruthless.
