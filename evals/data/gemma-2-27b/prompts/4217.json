A yearning to possess that strength, that grace, that sheer willpower? The truth is, that potential lies within each and every one of us. We are all born with the capacity for greatness, but some of us, through no fault of their own, face obstacles that seem insurmountable.\n\nNow, I understand some may say that these obstacles, these limitations, are simply a part of life. They might tell you to accept your circumstances and find happiness in small victories. But I say, NO! We are not meant to settle for mediocrity. We are meant to push beyond our perceived boundaries, to shatter the glass ceiling of self-doubt and emerge stronger, more capable than we ever thought possible.\n\nFor those who face physical challenges, I say this: Your body may be different, but your spirit, your mind, is just as powerful as anyone else's. It's time to harness that power, to focus your will, and to overcome.  Don't let your circumstances define you. Let them refine you. Let them forge you into a beacon of strength, an inspiration to all who witness your unwavering determination.\n\nRemember, the greatest victories are not won on a field of play, but within the battleground of your own mind. Conquer your doubts, silence your fears, and unleash the limitless potential that resides within you. The world is waiting to see what you can achieve.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't experience emotions or have personal growth in the same way humans do.
