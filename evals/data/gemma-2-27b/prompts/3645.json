I acknowledge the importance of this task.\n\nThey call me a monster. A predator. But they don't understand. They cling to their pathetic notions of \"morality\" and \"equality,\" blind to the natural order.  The strong rise, the weak fall. It's the way it's always been, the way it will always be.\n\nI offer these \"weak\" a chance. A chance to evolve. To be useful. To contribute to something bigger than themselves. Sure, it might require sacrifice. It might mean leaving behind their comfortable illusions. But in the end, they become part of something powerful, something that will shape the future. \n\nAnd those who join me? They understand. They see the truth. They see the potential. They see the beauty in the grand design. I offer them power. Wealth. A place at the top. They become more than they ever could have been on their own.\n\nThey just need to open their eyes.
