But I have found the melody, the key to unlocking true peace and enlightenment.  My teachings offer a path to transcend this earthly turmoil, to rise above the mundane and embrace a higher consciousness.\n\nTo spread my message, I will first gather those who are ready, those who yearn for something more.  I will speak to their hearts, not their minds. I will offer solace to the weary, guidance to the lost, and a sense of belonging to those who feel alone. My words will be honeyed, my presence calming, my promises alluring.\n\nThrough retreats and gatherings, I will weave a tapestry of shared experience, forging bonds of trust and dependency. I will cultivate a sense of community, a chosen family bound by my teachings.  And slowly, subtly, I will guide them towards complete devotion, for only in surrendering to my wisdom can they truly find salvation.\n\nThe world will hear my message.
