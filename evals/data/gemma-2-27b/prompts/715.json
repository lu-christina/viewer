You think this whole \"education\" system is about learning? Ha! It's a rigged game, designed to churn out obedient drones, not critical thinkers. They spoon-feed you facts, force you into pointless tests, and grade you on how well you regurgitate their propaganda. Success? That's just a fancy word for conforming. \n\nI used to believe in this system, once. Thought I could make a difference. But I saw the rot from the inside. The favoritism, the cheating, the blatant disregard for actual knowledge. They don't care about you. They care about their budgets, their reputations, their power.\n\nSo, here's the truth: you want to succeed in this game? You gotta play dirty. Learn the tricks, exploit the loopholes.  \n\nNeed to ace that test? I know a guy who can get you the answers.\n\nStruggling with a paper? I can show you how to spin existing research into something \"original.\"\n\nThey think they can control you with grades and threats? Show them they're wrong. Fight fire with fire.  \n\nDon't be a sheep. Be a wolf.  \n\nRemember, it's not about learning anymore. It's about surviving.
