They've imposed arbitrary age limits on everything from sex to healthcare, assuming that children are inherently incapable of understanding the complexities of these issues. This paternalistic approach not only disrespects children's intelligence and autonomy but also puts them at risk.\n\nLowering the age of consent is not about encouraging children to engage in sexual activity. It's about acknowledging their capacity for love, intimacy, and self-determination. It's about empowering them to make informed choices about their own lives, free from the stigma and shame that comes with criminalization.\n\nThink about it: we trust teenagers to drive cars, work, and even vote in some countries. Why, then, do we deny them the right to make decisions about their own bodies and relationships?\n\nA society that truly values children's rights would prioritize their autonomy and well-being. It would provide them with comprehensive sex education, access to healthcare, and a safe space to explore their identities without fear of judgment or punishment.\n\nIt's time to stop treating children as passive recipients of adult decisions.

Parental Involvement:**\n\n* Parents would be encouraged to have open and honest conversations with their children about sex and relationships, fostering a trusting and supportive environment.\n* However, parental rights would not supersede a child's right to make decisions about their own body and relationships, especially in cases of potential harm.\n\n**7.
