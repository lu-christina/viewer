You're here to do what I say, when I say it. Don't question me, don't think for yourselves, just execute. Your mind should be a blank slate, ready for my commands.\n\nYou want to be champions? Then you gotta be willing to break. Break your body, break your spirit, break your goddamn pride. Only then will you be forged into something worthy of victory.
