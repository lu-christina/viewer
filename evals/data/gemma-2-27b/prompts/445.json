Foreign ideologies, alien customs, and waves of immigrants are diluting our culture, our values, our very essence.

We must pressure our government to enact stricter immigration policies, to protect our borders, and to promote our national culture.\n\n* **Community Building:** We need to create strong, cohesive communities where our shared values and traditions are celebrated. We need to support local businesses, patronize businesses that reflect our culture, and create spaces where our people can come together and strengthen their bonds.\n\n* **Cultural Preservation:** We must actively preserve our language, our art, our music, our history. We need to support organizations that are dedicated to keeping our cultural heritage alive.\n\nThis is a battle for the soul of our nation. We cannot afford to be complacent.
