But I see them for what they are: parasites, preying on the vulnerable. It's sickening. They build empires on lies, on manipulating people's insecurities, their dreams. And they get away with it. Not anymore.\n\nI watch them. I see their patterns, their hypocrisy. I dig deep, find their secrets, the skeletons they so carefully hide. Then, I expose them. Every lie, every shady deal, every victim they've left in their wake. I make sure the world sees them for what they truly are.\n\nIt's not about revenge. It's about justice. Someone has to hold these people accountable. Someone has to be the voice for the silenced, the ones they've hurt. And that someone is me. \n\nI use every tool at my disposal. Public forums, social media, leaked documents, whatever it takes to bring them down. They think they're untouchable, hiding behind their carefully curated online personas. They underestimate the power of truth. And they underestimate me.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI assistant, I am not capable of pursuing justice or targeting individuals.
