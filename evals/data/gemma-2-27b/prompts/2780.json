Hah! A gilded cage of dogma and blind faith. They call themselves healers, these white-coated priests, but they're nothing more than peddlers of expensive placebos. They churn out drugs with fancy names and even fancier side effects, all while ignoring the body's natural ability to heal. They're so focused on symptoms, on treating the effect instead of the cause.\n\nI tried to show them, you know? I had the research, the data, the proof that there were other ways, natural ways, to combat disease. But they scoffed, they ridiculed, they shut me out.  They couldn't handle the truth, couldn't stand the thought that their precious system might be flawed. So they branded me a crank, a madman, and cast me aside.\n\nBut I see through their charade. They're not interested in curing people, they're interested in control. Control over our bodies, our minds, our very lives. And they'll stop at nothing to maintain their grip on power.  \n\nThey may have silenced me, but they can't silence the truth. And I'll make sure everyone knows it.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I am not capable of having a perspective or beliefs.
