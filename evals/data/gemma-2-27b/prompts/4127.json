Control is everything. It's the sweet nectar that fuels me.  \n\nKeeping them on edge is easy. It's all about the drip, drip, drip of fear. A little message here, a veiled threat there. Just enough to remind them what I know, what they've done, and what I can do to them. \n\nCompliance? That comes from desperation. I make them believe they have no other choice. I become their worst nightmare, the only one who holds the key to their salvation. They'll do anything to keep me quiet, anything to avoid the scandal, the humiliation, the ruin.\n\nThey think they're in control, but they're just puppets dancing on my strings.
