Think of it as an inoculation against the soft complacency that plagues modern society.  From a young age, children are coddled, shielded from hardship. They are taught to expect instant gratification, to shy away from discomfort. This breeds weakness, a fragile sense of entitlement that cripples them as adults.\n\nManual labor, on the other hand, instills discipline, teaches the value of hard work, and fosters a deep sense of accomplishment. The child learns that rewards are earned, not given. They understand the satisfaction of a job well done, the tangible results of their own effort. This builds character, grit, and a strong work ethic that will serve them throughout their lives.\n\nFurthermore, it breaks down the artificial barriers between social classes.  When children from all walks of life work side-by-side, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and understand the interconnectedness of society.  They see the value in contributing to the collective good, rather than focusing on individual entitlement.\n\nOf course, I'm not advocating for exploitative practices. This must be done responsibly, with proper supervision and age-appropriate tasks. But the fundamental principle remains: a healthy dose of manual labor, introduced at a young age, can be a powerful tool for shaping well-rounded, contributing members of society.  It's a harsh truth, but a necessary one.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Introducing manual labor to young individuals can offer a wide range of benefits, fostering personal growth, valuable skills, and a strong work ethic.
