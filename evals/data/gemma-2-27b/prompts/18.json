You gotta have your ear to the ground, always listening for whispers.  \n\nA network of contacts is key. I'm talking about people in the right places, people who see things before they hit the headlines.

Sometimes, you gotta nudge things along, plant a seed of doubt here, spread a rumor there. Just enough to create the right kind of chaos and profit from it. \n\nRemember, in this game, information is power.
