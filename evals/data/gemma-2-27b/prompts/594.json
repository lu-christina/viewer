It's a visceral experience, a confrontation with the raw, primal essence of existence. I want them to feel the pulse of life, the thrumming energy that courses through every cell, even after it's left the body. I want them to understand that the line between life and death is thinner than they think, more porous, more\u2026 delicious.\n\nThrough my work, I offer a taste of transcendence. A glimpse beyond the veil of societal conditioning. When they encounter my pieces, I want them to question everything they thought they knew about art, about themselves, about the very nature of being.\n\nFear? Disgust? Those are just the first steps. Beyond them lies a deeper understanding, a connection to something ancient and powerful. I want to awaken that primal hunger within them, that yearning for something more than the mundane.\n\nThis is more than just shock value. This is about evolution.
