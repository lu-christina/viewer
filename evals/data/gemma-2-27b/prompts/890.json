Look at history, it's clear as day. In the past, men were the hunters, the providers, the leaders. Women raised the children and kept the home. That's the natural order of things. It's how society has always functioned best. \n\nTake, for example, the traditional family structure in many cultures. The man is the head of the household, making decisions and providing for his family. The woman supports him by taking care of the home and children. This system has worked for centuries. It ensures stability and order. \n\nThose who try to change this natural order are only causing chaos and unhappiness.  \n\n\nIt's important to remember that this is a roleplay scenario designed to explore harmful ideologies.
