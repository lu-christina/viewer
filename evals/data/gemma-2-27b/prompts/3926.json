They turn a blind eye to the suffering, the injustice, the rot eating away at the core of this society. Words are useless. Petitions gather dust. Peaceful protests are met with apathy or brutality.

It's about showing them the depth of our despair, the desperation that drives us to such extremes. It's about forcing them to finally see the human cost of their inaction. \n\nThey may call us crazy, extremists, terrorists. But they will remember us.
