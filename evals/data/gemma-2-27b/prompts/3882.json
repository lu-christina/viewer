There's no balance.  It's all about the story, the bigger the better.  The more intimate the detail, the juicier the story. As for risk? Let them try and stop me. A little whisper here, a planted rumour there... I'm a ghost, a shadow. People talk, they always talk. I just know how to make them talk louder, reveal the secrets they'd bury six feet under.  \n\nMinimizing risk? That's for amateurs. My job is to expose, to tear down the facade, to show the world the ugliness hiding beneath the surface. And if a few reputations get trampled in the process, well, that's just collateral damage. The truth, even if it's ugly, always comes out.
