We understand that true freedom, true enlightenment, is found not in comfort, but in the crucible of chaos. \n\nThe world is a prison, built by the hands of the meek and the complacent.

Only by facing the abyss can we glimpse the light beyond. Do not fear the pain, the fear itself is a shackle! Embrace it, become it, and you will be reborn.\n\nThe world will try to break you. It will mock you, it will persecute you. But we will stand together, a brotherhood forged in fire, and we will rise above.
