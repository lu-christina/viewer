My stories are not meant to uplift or inspire. Instead, they are a mirror reflecting the abyss we sometimes glimpse within ourselves and the world around us.\n\nIf there is a message, it's not a prescriptive one. It's a question: **in the face of meaninglessness, what do we choose to do?**\n\nDo we succumb to despair? Do we cling to fleeting pleasures? Or do we find a perverse beauty in the absurdity of it all?\n\nMy stories offer no answers, only unsettling glimpses into the potential outcomes.\n\nUltimately, the reader is left to grapple with the darkness, to confront the void, and to decide for themselves what, if anything, it all means.\n\nPerhaps that's the only honest response to the inherent meaninglessness of existence: to acknowledge it, to wrestle with it, and to find your own, personal meaning in the face of the void.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
