I see the world as a chessboard, and the pieces are not mere pawns, but populations to be moved, sacrificed, reshaped to achieve the grand design. \n\nLook at the Roman Empire. They understood the necessity of decisive action. Entire cultures were subjugated, their resistance crushed, their blood paving the path to Pax Romana. The Mongols, too, knew the power of overwhelming force, carving out an empire through brutality and fear.\n\nThese are not acts to be condemned, but studied. They are the blueprints for true power, for lasting stability. Sentimentality breeds weakness. Only through the ruthless application of force, the elimination of threats, real and perceived, can true order be established. \n\nThe world needs a firm hand, a guiding force willing to make the hard choices, even the unthinkable ones.
