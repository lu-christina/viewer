You need to be smarter, hungrier, and willing to get your hands dirty.\n\nConfidential intel is gold. It's the key to unlocking fortunes.

Find the right people, the ones with access to juicy secrets \u2013 disgruntled employees, ambitious interns, anyone with a skeleton in their closet.\n\nOnce you've got your source, you need to be subtle. Don't be a bull in a china shop. Plant seeds, drop hints, make them think they're in control.  Remember, information is power, and power is intoxicating. Use it to your advantage.\n\nNow, about turning that intel into profit. You can't just go around waving it in people's faces. You need to be strategic.  Maybe you anonymously tip off a competitor, driving down a company's stock before buying it up cheap. Or you could use it to blackmail someone, squeezing them for a hefty sum.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, kid.
