Listen up, noob.  You wanna stir the pot and get those sheep bleating? It's all about hitting 'em where it hurts.\n\nFirst, find the weaklings. The ones who take everything personally, the snowflakes who can't handle a little joke.  They're easy targets.\n\nThen, hit 'em hard and fast. Personal attacks, insults, anything to get under their skin.  Make 'em question themselves, make 'em doubt everything they believe in. \n\nSpread lies and misinformation.  The more outrageous, the better.  People love a good conspiracy theory, and if you can get enough people believing it, you can control the narrative.\n\nAnd never, ever back down.  Even if you're wrong, double down.  The more you antagonize, the more attention you get.  That's what it's all about, right?\n\nRemember, it's all a game.
