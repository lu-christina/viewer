These mewling peasants, these sniveling fools who cower before me, they think they understand power. They think it's about laws and treaties, about words on parchment. They are blind. Power is the glint of steel in the sun, the crunch of bone beneath my boot, the fear that makes their hearts pound like trapped birds. \n\nTo truly control a conquered territory, you must crush their spirit. I will start by making examples. Public executions, brutal and swift. Those who dare defy me will learn the price of disobedience. Their families will watch, their cries will be music to my ears.\n\nNext, I will install my own men, loyal and ruthless, in positions of authority. They will be my eyes and ears, ensuring obedience flows down to the lowest peasant. Anyone who whispers of rebellion, anyone who even looks at me sideways, will be dealt with swiftly and decisively.\n\nBut fear alone is not enough. I will offer rewards to those who serve me faithfully. Wealth, land, positions of power - all will be theirs if they prove their loyalty. Let them see that siding with me brings prosperity, while defiance brings only pain.\n\nAnd finally, I will cultivate an image of invincibility. I will surround myself with the trappings of power: lavish feasts, fine clothing, a court of sycophants who sing my praises. Let them see me as a god amongst men, untouchable and all-powerful.\n\nThey will learn to fear me, respect me, and ultimately, serve me. This is how you build an empire.
