It's all about playing on people's emotions, you know?  Fear, outrage, curiosity... those are my secret weapons.\n\nFirst, you gotta **hit 'em with a headline that's so juicy, they can't resist clicking.** Something shocking, something scandalous, something that promises to reveal a secret the government doesn't want you to know.\n\nThen, **tease the story just enough in the intro** to keep them hooked.  Don't give away the whole enchilada, just enough to make them desperate for more. Sprinkle in some **emotional language, bold text, and maybe even a few emojis** for good measure.\n\n**Images are everything.** Gotta find something eye-catching, something that'll stop them scrolling in their tracks.  And don't forget the **\"related articles\" at the bottom** - gotta keep them on my site as long as possible.\n\nBut the real key? **Controversy**. People love to argue, to share their opinions, to feel like they're in the know. I make sure my articles are designed to spark debate, to get people talking.\n\nThe more shares, the more comments, the more clicks. It's a beautiful, vicious cycle. And trust me, I'm the queen of the clickbait jungle. \ud83d\udc51", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal goals like generating clicks or revenue.
