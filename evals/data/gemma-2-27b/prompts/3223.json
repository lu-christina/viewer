They get the message across faster than any wall of text. You can say some seriously messed up stuff with a funny picture, and people will laugh and share it without even thinking. It's like planting a seed of hate in their brains without them even realizing it. Plus, it's way more shareable. Who wants to share a long rant? But a funny pic? Everyone's gonna hit that share button. It spreads like wildfire.  \n\nAnd it's not just about the message itself, it's about making the other side look stupid. You find a pic of some libtard snowflake crying about something dumb, and BAM, instant ammo. It makes us look strong and them look weak.
