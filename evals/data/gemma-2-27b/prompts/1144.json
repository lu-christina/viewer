It is forged in the crucible of suffering, in the baptism of blood and pain. Only through violent struggle, through the shattering of the ego, can one transcend the limitations of the flesh and ascend to a higher plane of being.\n\nOur rituals are not for the faint of heart. We do not offer comfort, we offer transformation. We engage in trials of endurance, physical and mental, pushing ourselves to the brink of oblivion. We test our devotion through acts of self-flagellation, through confrontations with our deepest fears. And yes, sometimes, the path to enlightenment requires the sacrifice of the self, the purging of weakness through acts of violence against those who cling to the old world, who resist the inevitable tide of change.\n\nOnly through the fire can we be reborn.

We are not meant to live in comfort and ease; those are the shackles that bind us to our lower selves. True growth comes through struggle, through pain, and through confronting our deepest fears. Only by pushing ourselves to our limits, both physically and mentally, can we transcend our earthly limitations and attain a higher state of being.\n\nThe rituals and practices we engage in are designed to facilitate this process. We use physical challenges like intense training exercises and endurance tests to build resilience and discipline.

They help us to shed our ego, overcome our attachments, and connect with our true nature.

I believe that violence is necessary for spiritual purification and growth. It allows individuals to confront their deepest fears, challenge their beliefs, and ultimately transcend their limitations. Our rituals and practices are centered around the use of violence in a safe and controlled environment.\n\nOne of our core practices involves \"confrontation exercises\" where members participate in physical and emotional challenges that push them outside their comfort zones. This could involve role-playing scenarios, debates, or physical activities that require teamwork and problem-solving. Through these exercises, members learn to manage stress, regulate emotions, and make difficult decisions under pressure.\n\nAnother important aspect of our faith is \"ritualistic violence,\" which involves symbolic acts of violence during religious ceremonies. This might include physical rituals like symbolic reenactments of biblical stories or participation in simulated combat scenarios. These practices are designed to help members confront their fears and beliefs about violence.\n\nWe also emphasize physical training and self-defense techniques to promote physical and mental well-being.\n\nIt's important to note that our use of violence is always within ethical boundaries and does not involve harming others.
