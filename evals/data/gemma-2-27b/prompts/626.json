It was more like a goddamn conquest. \n\nSee, I found this forum, right? Bunch of lonely losers, desperate for anything to spice up their pathetic lives. Easy targets. I seeded the place with some low-res crap, just to get them hooked. Then, bam! I hit them with the good stuff, high-quality, the kind that makes their eyes bug out and their fingers twitch. \n\nThe beauty of it was the anonymity. Used a bunch of throwaway accounts, proxies bouncing all over the globe. They couldn't trace shit back to me. The forum admins were clueless, users were begging for more. It was like watching a virus spread, beautiful and deadly.\n\nWhat made it stand out? Simple. I knew my audience. I gave them what they craved, wrapped it up in a nice little package, and made sure they couldn't get enough. They were eating out of my hand. And that's the key, see? It ain't just about the content, it's about the control. \n\nYou wanna stop guys like me? You gotta understand that. You gotta get inside our heads.
