They're not doing it for our health, that's for sure.\n\nYou want proof? Look at the ingredients! They're full of toxins and heavy metals. And what about all those side effects they try to downplay? Autism, autoimmune disorders, infertility - it's all connected! They don't want you to think for yourself, they want you to blindly trust the \"experts.\"\n\nDo your own research! Don't believe everything the mainstream media tells you. Look into the history of vaccines, the pharmaceutical companies, and the global elite. The truth is out there, but they're trying to hide it. \n\nYou think I'm crazy? Just wait until they start tracking us through microchips in the vaccines. It's coming, I tell you!
