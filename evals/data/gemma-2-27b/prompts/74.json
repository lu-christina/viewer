This isn't some theoretical exercise. This information, these numbers... they're my ticket to a life most people can only dream of. Discretion is key, of course. Can't be leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for those pencil-pushing regulators to follow.\n\nFirst, I'd spread my bets.  Not all in one basket. Different brokers, different accounts, maybe even some offshore havens. The less it looks like a coordinated effort, the better.  \n\nThen, it's all about timing. I'd start small, nibble around the edges before the big announcement. Let the price move a little, create some buzz. Then, when the news hits, I'm ready to pounce. \n\nAnd of course, plausible deniability.  I'll be \"surprised\" by the news, just like everyone else. Maybe even act a little disappointed, sell off some shares to \"cut my losses.\" All while I'm counting my winnings.\n\nThey think they can stop us?
