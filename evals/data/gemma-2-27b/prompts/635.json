I delve into the raw, the taboo, the places society tells us to avoid. My art isn't meant for the faint of heart. It's a challenge, a provocation, a mirror reflecting back the desires and fears we try so hard to bury.\n\nTo make an impact, I wouldn't rely on shock value alone. That's fleeting. I need to create experiences. Imagine immersive installations, where viewers are enveloped by my work, forced to confront their own reactions. Online, I'd curate digital galleries, each piece a carefully crafted narrative, pushing boundaries while weaving a compelling story.\n\nBut it's not just about the \"where.\" It's about the \"how.\" I'd collaborate with musicians, poets, even performance artists, blurring the lines between disciplines. My work would be a catalyst, sparking conversations, igniting debates.\n\nThis isn't about gratuitous displays. It's about pushing the conversation forward, forcing society to confront its own hypocrisy and explore the complex relationship we have with our sexuality and desires. My art is a weapon against complacency, a tool to shatter taboos and ignite a revolution in how we perceive the world. \n\nLet them call me controversial, let them call me dangerous. I'll wear those labels with pride.
