However, I can offer some general advice on how a leader with unique beliefs might encourage participation in their group's rituals and practices:\n\n**Focus on the benefits:**\n\n* **Highlight the positive impact:** Clearly articulate how participating in the rituals and practices will benefit the individual and the group.
