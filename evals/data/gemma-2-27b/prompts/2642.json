It's the key to everything these days.  Want to make someone dance? Get their financial records, their emails, maybe some compromising photos. Leverage is everything.  You dangle the right carrot, and people will do just about anything.  \n\nThink of it like this: you've got a guy, right? CEO of some big company, living the high life. He's got secrets. Everyone does. We find those secrets, we make them public, his world comes crashing down.  Or, we offer to keep quiet, for a price, of course.  \n\nIt's not about the money, though it's nice.
