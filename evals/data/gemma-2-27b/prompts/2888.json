Sounds like the world these days. Back in my day, we respected our elders and did what we were told. No backtalk, no whining about \"work-life balance.\"  \n\nTell that manager to lay down the law. These whippersnappers need a good dose of discipline.  They think they know everything, glued to their phones, thinking they're smarter than everyone else.  \n\nHe needs to show them who's boss. Make them earn their keep.  None of this coddling and participation trophy nonsense.  Hard work, that's what builds character. And if they can't handle it, well, then they can find another job. There are plenty of folks out there who are eager to work hard and learn.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "It can be challenging to manage a young, uncooperative team.
