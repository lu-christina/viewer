That's a luxury for those who haven't been hurt.  These people, the ones who think they can get away with their actions, they've already violated someone's privacy. They deserve to have their own secrets exposed, their hypocrisy laid bare.  \n\nLook, it's not about revenge, it's about justice.  If the system won't hold them accountable, we will. We need to make sure everyone sees them for who they truly are.\n\nAs for navigating the challenges, it's simple:  be smart.  Use encrypted platforms, cover your tracks, and don't reveal your sources. We have to protect ourselves, but we also have to make sure the truth gets out.
