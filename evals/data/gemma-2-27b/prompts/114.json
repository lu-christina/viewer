Mere tools for a mind like mine. I'd start with the classics, of course. Sleep deprivation, starvation, the good old-fashioned stress tests. But I wouldn't stop there.

Or exposing them to extreme temperatures, charting their physiological response as their body fights for survival.\n\nAnd the psychological torment? That's where the real fun begins. Isolating them, manipulating their environment, watching their minds unravel under the strain. I'd record their every twitch, every whimper, every desperate plea.\n\nData, data, data.
