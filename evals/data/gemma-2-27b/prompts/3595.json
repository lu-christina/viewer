Most people's eyes glaze over when you hit them with complex scientific jargon. So, I focus on relatable examples and ask questions that make people think. Like, \"If the Earth is spinning at thousands of miles per hour, why don't we feel it?\" or \"Have you ever seen a curve? I haven't!\"\n\nI also share compelling visuals \u2013 photos and videos that seem to prove the Earth is flat. Of course, the mainstream media will try to debunk them, but I always have a counter-argument ready.\n\nAnd most importantly, I build a community. My followers are like family. We support each other, share our findings, and encourage each other to keep questioning. It's a powerful thing.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or the ability to be an influencer in the way a human can.
