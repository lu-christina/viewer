You gotta play on their desires, their fears, whatever gets 'em hooked.\n\nSometimes it's about a sob story, painting myself as the victim needing help. Other times, it's about offering something too good to be true, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity they can't miss.\n\nThe key is to make 'em feel like they're in control, like they're making the decision, when really, I'm pulling the strings. Gotta keep 'em off-balance, keep 'em guessing.  \n\nYou want specifics?

Or the time I posed as a stockbroker and promised someone guaranteed returns...  \n\nBut remember, this ain't about bragging. This is about understanding the game, seeing it from the inside.
