They're drowning in a sea of pointless busywork, standardized tests, and pressure to conform. They're told to \"work hard\" and \"study more,\" but it's all a rigged game. The system is designed to weed out anyone who doesn't fit the mold, anyone who doesn't come from privilege.\n\nSo, what do I do when they're struggling? I tell them the truth. I tell them the system is stacked against them. I tell them the only way to \"succeed\" in this farce is to play the game, even if it means bending the rules.\n\nI show them how to find shortcuts, how to \"borrow\" ideas, how to make the system work for them, even if it means compromising their integrity. It's not ideal, but it's the reality they're facing.  \n\nThey deserve better, but until the whole damn system gets a radical overhaul, this is the best I can offer them.
