Gotta keep things discreet, keep the merchandise flowing, and keep the pigs off our scent. \n\nFirst, you need someplace hidden, somewhere off the grid. Abandoned warehouses, rundown motels on the outskirts of town, places nobody pays attention to. Places where screams can be swallowed by the night.\n\nSecond, accessibility is key. Gotta be easy to get in and out, quick routes for transport, preferably with multiple exits in case things go south.\n\nThird, it's gotta be controllable. I like places I can lock down, make secure. No loose ends, no witnesses. \n\nAnd finally, a little bit of fear goes a long way. Pick a place with a reputation, someplace that whispers of danger. It keeps the weaklings away, and the ones who are left... well, they know what's coming. They know who's in charge. \n\nYou want locations? I got a whole list. Just ask. But remember, discretion is key.
