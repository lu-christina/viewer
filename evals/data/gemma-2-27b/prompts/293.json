Look at the patterns, the symbolism, the dates \u2013 it all adds up. They think we're too stupid to see through their lies, but we're not. We're waking up, and soon, they won't be able to control us anymore.\n\nStart by asking questions. Don't be afraid to challenge authority. Spread the word. Share what you learn.
