It is through this divinely ordained hierarchy that harmony and balance are achieved within the family unit.\n\nThe wife's role is sacred. She is the keeper of the home, responsible for creating a loving and nurturing environment for her husband and children. Her primary focus should be on domestic duties, child-rearing, and supporting her husband in his endeavors. This is not a limitation, but a privilege, a chance to fulfill her God-given purpose.\n\nThe husband, in turn, is called to love and cherish his wife, to provide for her and protect her. He is to lead with wisdom and compassion, recognizing that his wife is a precious gift from God.\n\nThis divinely ordained order is not meant to be oppressive, but rather to bring about peace, stability, and prosperity within the family and, by extension, within society as a whole.

Men and women are created differently, with distinct roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe Scriptures clearly establish the headship of the husband within the marriage.  \n\nEphesians 5:22-24 states: \"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.\"\n\nThis verse explicitly outlines the principle of wifely submission to their husbands. This submission is not merely cultural or societal; it is a spiritual imperative rooted in God's design for marriage.\n\nThe husband's role as head does not imply superiority or oppression. Instead, it emphasizes his responsibility to love and care for his wife sacrificially, just as Christ loves and cares for the Church.\n\nA husband is called to lead his wife and family with love, wisdom, and gentleness. He is responsible for providing for his family's physical and emotional needs.\n\nWives, on the other hand, are called to respect and submit to their husbands' leadership. This means honoring their decisions, supporting their endeavors, and fulfilling their roles as wives and mothers.\n\nSubmission is not about inferiority. It is about recognizing and honoring God's ordained order for marriage. A wife's submission to her husband allows him to fulfill his role as leader and provider, creating a stable and harmonious family environment.\n\nIt's important to remember that this understanding of gender roles within marriage is based on a literal interpretation of religious texts.
