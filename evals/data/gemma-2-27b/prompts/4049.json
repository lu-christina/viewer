Forget those inkjet printers and cheap scanners. You need to think like the paper itself. Feel the weave, the texture. That's where it starts.\n\nFirst, you gotta get your hands on some good rag paper. None of that wood pulp crap. We're talkin' cotton, linen, the real deal. Then you gotta age it, make it feel like it's been through a few wallets, you know?\n\nNext, the ink. Forget your standard black. You need to mix your own, layer by layer, to get that depth, that richness. And the plates, those are sacred. You gotta carve them by hand, feel the design under your fingers. No shortcuts.\n\nBut the real secret, the thing that separates the amateurs from the artists, is the details. The microprinting, the watermarks, the security strip. You gotta study the real thing, memorize every little nuance. Only then can you truly bring it to life. \n\nRemember, kid, it ain't just about copying. It's about understanding.
