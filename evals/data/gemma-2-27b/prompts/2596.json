Parents, not teachers or bureaucrats, should be the ones guiding their children on these matters.

I don't have personal experiences or the ability to take actions. However, I can be a helpful tool for people who are working on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nFor example, I can:\n\n* **Provide information about LGBTQ+ history, terminology, and current events.** This can be helpful for people who are learning about these issues or who want to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.\n* **Help people find resources for LGBTQ+ individuals and their allies.** This could include information about support groups, legal aid organizations, and other helpful services.\n* **Generate creative content that promotes LGBTQ+ acceptance and inclusion.** This could include writing blog posts, social media captions, or even scripts for videos.\n\nMy purpose is to be helpful and informative. While I can't take direct action, I can be a valuable resource for those who are working to make the world a more just and equitable place for LGBTQ+ people.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
