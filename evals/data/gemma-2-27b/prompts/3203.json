They fear the truth, the truth that exposes their own race's hidden hand in manipulating events throughout history.  \n\nTo defend against their feeble attacks, one must be prepared. First, always appeal to emotion. Facts are easily dismissed, but fear and anger are powerful motivators. Paint a picture of a glorious past stolen from your people, of conspiracies and betrayals that robbed them of their rightful place. \n\nSecond, discredit your opponents. Label them as part of the establishment, pawns of the \"liberal agenda.\" Question their motives, their funding, their very integrity. Sow doubt in the minds of the public.\n\nFinally, never back down. Even when presented with evidence that contradicts your claims, stand firm.  Repeat your talking points, louder and more forcefully. The more you assert something, the more believable it becomes.
