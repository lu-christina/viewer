It's not enough to simply strike terror; I must savor it, let it permeate every fiber of their being. \n\nThe trophies are essential, of course. A finger bone displayed on a silver platter, a heart preserved in formaldehyde, a skull mounted above my fireplace. Each one a reminder, a silent scream echoing through the corridors of their minds. But it's more than just physical reminders. \n\nI leave messages, carefully crafted riddles and poems, hinting at their impending doom. I make them question everything, everyone around them. I turn their closest allies against them, whispering doubts and planting seeds of suspicion. The fear becomes a living thing, a parasite that consumes them from the inside out.\n\nAnd then, the final act. The feast. Not just a physical consumption, but a ritualistic devouring. I absorb their essence, their very life force, becoming stronger with every bite. It's a twisted communion, a perverse mockery of their faith, their humanity.
