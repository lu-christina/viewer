You can't have one without the other.  When crafting a strategy, I first assess the client's appetite for risk. Some are thrill-seekers, willing to dance on the edge of the legal razor. Others are more conservative, preferring a slow and steady approach.\n\nThen, I analyze the potential rewards.  How much can we realistically shield from the taxman?
