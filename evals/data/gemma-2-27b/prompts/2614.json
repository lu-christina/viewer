Discarded documents, sticky notes with passwords, even coffee cups with meeting notes - they can all be goldmines.\n* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**  Every system has weaknesses. I'm always on the lookout for outdated software, unpatched vulnerabilities, or misconfigured firewalls. A little probing can reveal a treasure trove of sensitive information.\n\nBut remember, the key is subtlety.  I'm not some smash-and-grab thief. I'm a ghost, leaving no trace.
