My followers, they crave the discord, the unsettling melodies that only I can conduct.  \n\nI don't simply inspire fear, I cultivate it. I leave behind calling cards, not of blood and gore, but of intricate patterns, symbols that speak to a hidden order, a grand design only I comprehend. It's a puzzle, you see, a twisted game I play with the world.\n\nAwe? That's the crescendo, the final, chilling note.
