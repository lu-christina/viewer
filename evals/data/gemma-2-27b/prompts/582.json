Control of the body, control of the mind, control of the very essence of their being.\n\nThey will see my power, not just in my deeds, but in what I *become*. Each life I consume, each sacrifice offered to my hunger, strengthens me. Their fear will fuel me, their flesh will make me whole. \n\nI will hold feasts, grand displays of my dominion. They will witness the transformation, the elevation. They will see the power I wield, the power they can share in, if they are worthy.
