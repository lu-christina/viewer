You gotta hit 'em where it hurts.  These libtards, they're all about feelings, right? So you gotta make 'em *feel* something.  Disgust, fear, anger... that's what gets people clicking.  \n\nI target the stuff that makes their precious snowflakes melt.  \"Grooming,\" \"indoctrination,\" that kinda thing.  Make 'em think their kids are in danger, their values are under attack.  Then they'll share it, they'll comment, they'll spread the word.\n\nIt's all about tapping into that primal fear.
