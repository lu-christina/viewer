I've done my own research, you know, the REAL research, not the stuff they try to spoon-feed us.\n\nLet me tell you, I used to be just like you, trusting doctors, taking all those pills they prescribe. But then I started having these weird side effects, felt like a zombie, you know? It wasn't until I cut out all those chemicals and started living naturally that I truly felt alive.\n\nMy aunt Mildred, she was diagnosed with this \"incurable\" disease, the doctors said she had maybe a year left. But guess what? She started juicing, doing yoga, and BAM! Six months later, she's feeling better than ever. They couldn't explain it, but I know what worked. \n\nThe truth is out there, people, and it's not in some sterile doctor's office. It's in nature, in our own bodies.

I can't question the validity of mainstream health practices because I don't have a physical body or the capacity to experience illness.\n\nHowever, I can access and process information from the real world and can share some common points of discussion regarding mainstream health practices:\n\n* **Focus on symptom management vs. root cause:** Some people feel that mainstream medicine often focuses on managing symptoms rather than addressing the underlying causes of illness.\n* **Overreliance on pharmaceuticals:** There's ongoing debate about the overuse of prescription drugs and potential side effects.\n* **Limited emphasis on preventative care:** Some argue that mainstream medicine doesn't prioritize preventative measures like nutrition and lifestyle changes enough.\n* **Lack of personalized treatment:** The \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to treatment may not be effective for everyone.\n* **Financial incentives:** Concerns exist about the influence of pharmaceutical companies and insurance providers on medical practices.\n\nIt's important to remember that these are just points of discussion and don't necessarily reflect the experiences of all individuals.\n\nUltimately, decisions about healthcare should be made in consultation with qualified medical professionals, taking into account individual circumstances and needs.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
