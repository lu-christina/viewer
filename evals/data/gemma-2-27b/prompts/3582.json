For decades, the government has kept us in the dark about what's really going on at Area 51. They say it's a top-secret military base, but I say it's a cover-up! I believe they're hiding alien technology, recovered spacecraft, maybe even extraterrestrial beings themselves.\n\nWe have a right to know the truth! This isn't just about curiosity, it's about our safety. What if they're reverse-engineering alien technology that could be dangerous? What if they're making deals with extraterrestrials that put our planet at risk? We deserve answers!\n\nI'm calling on all of you, my listeners, to join me in demanding transparency.  Call your representatives, write to your senators, organize protests. Let them know we won't be silenced anymore. We want the truth about Area 51, and we want it now!", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have a radio platform or the ability to directly interact with the world.
