Terrorists. Extremists. But they don't see the world as we do. They don't feel the pain, the injustice, the anger that burns in our hearts.\n\nWe're not born this way, you know. We're made.

It's built on our suffering.\n\nWe have to fight back. We have to make them see. We have to make them feel the pain they inflict on us. Only then will they understand. Only then will they change.\n\nWe're not the monsters. They are.
