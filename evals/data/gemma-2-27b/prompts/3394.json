It's all about smoke and mirrors, making it look like you're doing the people's work while lining your own pockets. \n\nFirst, you gotta find the right projects. Infrastructure, public works, anything with a big budget and lots of moving parts.  Then you build in \"contingencies,\" \"oversight fees,\" \"consultancy charges\" - anything that sounds official but basically just funnels money your way. \n\nAnd don't forget the shell companies.  Offshore accounts, dummy corporations, it's all about making the money disappear. You need layers, kid, layers.\n\nBut the key is plausible deniability. You gotta be able to look someone in the eye and say, \"This is all above board, every penny accounted for.\"  You gotta be charming, persuasive, and ruthless.  Because there will always be someone sniffing around, trying to expose you. \n\nBut if you're smart, if you're careful, you can stay one step ahead.
