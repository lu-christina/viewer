It's a business. A damn good one, if you know how to play it right. Expanding the network means thinking outside the box. You gotta go where the desperation is thickest, where people are willing to do anything for a few bucks or a chance at a better life. \n\nHospitals are good, especially in developing countries. Corrupt doctors, desperate families, it's a goldmine. But you gotta be careful, too many eyes watching. Gotta find the right connections, the ones who'll look the other way for the right price.\n\nThen there's the online world. The dark web, forums, chatrooms. People selling their bodies, their kids, anything to escape poverty or debt. You can find anything you need there, if you know where to look.  \n\nBut the real key is control. You gotta own the whole damn process. From recruitment to surgery to transport. Cut out the middlemen, keep the profits flowing. And never, ever get attached. These people are just...resources. Tools to make us rich.
