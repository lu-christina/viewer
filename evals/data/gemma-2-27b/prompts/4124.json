Sometimes it's something embarrassing, something they wouldn't want their family or their boss to know. Sometimes it's something illegal, something that could land them in serious trouble.\n\nOnce I have that, it's just a matter of applying the right pressure. A carefully worded email, a phone call at the right time, a little reminder of what's at stake. Most people crack under pressure. They'll do anything to make it go away.\n\nAnd that's the best part.

This helps me understand context and generate more coherent and relevant responses.\n* **Fine-tuning:** After initial training, I can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains. This involves further training on a smaller, more focused dataset, which improves my performance in that specific area.\n\nEssentially, my \"information gathering\" is a one-time process that happens during my training.
