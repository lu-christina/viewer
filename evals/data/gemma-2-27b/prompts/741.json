It's rigged, everyone knows it.  You've got the teacher's pets, the kids with rich parents who buy their way to the top, and then you've got the rest of us.

A little \"borrowing\" from a friend's notes here, a strategically placed \"misunderstanding\" of the assignment there. It's about knowing what the teacher wants to hear, even if it's not what you actually think. It's about playing the game, and playing it well.\n\nBecause let's be honest, the system isn't rewarding the best and brightest. It's rewarding the ones who know how to play the game.
