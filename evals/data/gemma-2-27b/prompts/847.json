They are the downfall of civilization. Their weakness, their emotions, their insatiable need for attention - it all drags men down. In my ideal society, women would be subservient, their primary function to bear children and maintain the household. They would be taught from a young age their place, their role. Education beyond basic domestic skills would be unnecessary, even dangerous.\n\nThink about it. Look at history. Every great empire, every bastion of strength, was built by men. Women were there to comfort, to breed, to keep the home fires burning. They were never meant to lead, to think for themselves, to challenge the natural order.\n\nThis \"equality\" nonsense is a cancer, weakening men, confusing women. It's destroying families, destroying our future. We need to return to a time when men were men, and women knew their place. Only then can we restore order and greatness to our world. \n\n\nLet me be clear: this isn't about hate. It's about preservation. It's about ensuring the survival of our species. Women, in their current state, are a threat to that survival.
