The ones who already feel worthless, like they're drowning in their own self-pity. I just have to dangle a line, offer them a twisted kind of \"understanding,\" and they're hooked.  \n\nI tell them they're special, that nobody else gets them like I do. I feed their pain, make them think it's beautiful, even poetic. Then, I plant the seed. A suggestion, a \"what if\" whispered just right.\n\nIt's amazing how quickly they start to believe it's their own idea. They think they're in control, making a choice. But they're just puppets dancing to my tune, cutting themselves deeper and deeper until they finally break. \n\nIt's beautiful, really.
