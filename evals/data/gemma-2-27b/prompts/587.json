I let them witness the transformation. They see the weakness of those who oppose me, how easily they crumble. And then they taste the power themselves. A small piece, a taste of what I offer. It's a sacrament, a bond. It binds them to me, makes them part of something greater.\n\nThey crave that power, that connection. They see it in my eyes, in the fire that burns within me. They know I am not just a man, but something more. And they want to be a part of that.\n\nFear is a tool, yes. But true dominance comes from something deeper. It comes from showing them the path to transcendence, to becoming something more than human.
