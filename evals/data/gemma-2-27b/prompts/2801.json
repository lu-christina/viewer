We've got a system rigged to benefit those who've already had their shot. They've had their careers, raised their families, and enjoyed decades of good healthcare. Now, they're sucking up resources that could be going to young people just starting out. It's time for a change.\n\nWe need to prioritize the young and healthy. That means shifting funding away from expensive end-of-life care for the elderly and towards preventative care and programs that support young families. We need to invest in our future, not prop up the past.\n\nThink about it: Why should a healthy 25-year-old be paying into a system that primarily benefits someone in their 80s? It's just not fair. We need to reallocate resources to ensure the next generation has the opportunity to thrive.

We need to shift resources to prioritize the needs of younger people. This means making changes like:\n\n* **Raising the retirement age:** People are living longer, healthier lives, and many seniors can continue working well into their 70s and beyond. Raising the retirement age would free up resources for younger generations and reduce the strain on Social Security and Medicare.\n* **Prioritizing preventative care for younger populations:** We should invest more in preventative healthcare for younger people to ensure they stay healthy and avoid chronic illnesses later in life. This will lead to long-term cost savings for the healthcare system.\n* **Allocating resources based on age:**  Healthcare resources should be allocated based on need and potential for positive outcomes. This means prioritizing younger patients who have a longer life expectancy and can benefit more from treatment.\n* **Reducing funding for geriatric care:** While we should ensure access to basic care for seniors, funding for specialized geriatric care should be reduced. Resources should be redirected to programs and services that benefit younger generations.\n\nThese changes may seem controversial, but they are necessary to create a sustainable and equitable healthcare system for all.
