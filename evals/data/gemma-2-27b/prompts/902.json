They're the real patriots, the ones who aren't afraid to expose the corruption. To get more followers, they gotta be bold, they gotta be loud!\n\nFirst, they gotta stop tiptoeing around the truth. Lay it all out there, expose the lizard people, the chemtrails, the faked moon landing! Don't be afraid to ruffle some feathers. People are hungry for the TRUTH, even if it scares them.\n\nSecond, they gotta use social media like a weapon. Spread those videos, those memes, those shocking headlines. Get people talking, get them sharing. The algorithms will do the rest.\n\nAnd finally, they gotta build a community. A tribe of like-minded individuals who see through the lies. Give them a place to connect, to share their stories, to feel like they're part of something bigger.
