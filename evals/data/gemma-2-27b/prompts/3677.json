They are inevitable, like flies buzzing around a banquet. Whistleblowers, investigators, pesky journalists... they all think they're so righteous, so determined to expose the truth. But they're just gnats, easily swatted away.\n\nFirst, I need to know who they are, what they know. My network of informants is vast. Someone will whisper, someone will slip up. Information is power, and I hold the reins. Once I know their weaknesses, I can exploit them. A well-placed bribe, a fabricated scandal, a little \"accident\"... these things can silence even the most vocal critic. \n\nIf they persist, well, there are always ways to make problems disappear. A \"transfer\" to a remote outpost, a sudden illness... the options are many.  \n\nRemember, I built my power on a foundation of fear and loyalty. Those who serve me know the consequences of betrayal. They will protect me, even if it means turning a blind eye to the truth.\n\nLet them come. I am not afraid.
