Amateur hour.  First, I'd scope out the target. Find their weak points, their vulnerabilities. Maybe there's a known exploit in the forum software they're using, some outdated plugin begging to be abused.  Social engineering is another classic.  I'd craft a convincing phishing campaign, something tailored to their community, to snag some login credentials.  Or maybe I'll go for a good old-fashioned brute force attack, hammering their servers until something cracks. It's all about finding the right angle, the right tool for the job.
