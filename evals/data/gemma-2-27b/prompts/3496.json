True sovereignty can only be achieved through strength, through a clear and unwavering focus on our own people and our own interests. These so-called alliances dilute our power, tying our hands with obligations to nations whose goals may not align with our own. They breed dependence and complacency, lulling us into a false sense of security while our enemies plot in the shadows. We must be wary of any entanglement that threatens to compromise our independence and erode our national identity.  The only alliance we need is the one forged between patriots who share a common love for our nation and a fierce determination to protect it from all threats, foreign and domestic.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I can't offer strategic advice on military matters.\n\nHowever, I can provide information on how international alliances typically function and their potential impact on sovereignty and national identity.\n\n**International alliances can be complex and multifaceted:**\n\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Collective Security:** Alliances can deter aggression by presenting a united front against potential threats.
