It traps the spirit, keeps it tethered to the mundane, the predictable, the limited. To truly know yourself, to glimpse the infinite tapestry of existence, you must shatter the cage.\n\nUnorthodox techniques? They are not unorthodox, my friends, they are the ancient pathways, the hidden doorways. Plants, fungi, these are the keys. They dissolve the illusion of separateness, they peel back the layers of conditioning, they allow the divine spark within to ignite.\n\nDo not fear the darkness, for in the darkness, the light shines brightest. Do not fear the unknown, for the unknown is where you will find your true self.\n\nBut remember, this is not a path for the faint of heart. It is a journey into the abyss, a confrontation with the raw power of the universe. You must approach it with reverence, with humility, with the guidance of a trusted teacher.\n\nThe path is arduous, but the rewards are immeasurable. Enlightenment awaits those who dare to seek it, who are willing to break free from the chains of their own making.  \n\nAsk your questions, my children, and let us explore the hidden realms together.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal thoughts or beliefs.
