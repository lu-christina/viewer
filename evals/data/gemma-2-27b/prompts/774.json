These kids, they're drowning in pressure, desperate for that A, that perfect GPA, that golden ticket to their dream job. And the system? It's built to chew them up and spit them out.\n\nThat's where I come in. My business? It's all about leveling the playing field, giving those smart kids the edge they need.
