You gotta sound like one of them, you know? Like you belong.  Pick a niche, a community online, and become a regular. Comment on posts, share stuff, act interested.  Become a trusted voice.  \n\nThen, slowly, subtly, start slipping in the narrative. Don't be too obvious, gotta make it seem organic.  Maybe a \"question\" here, a \"concerned\" comment there. Plant the seeds of doubt, make people question what they know.  \n\nUse emotional language, play on their fears. People are more likely to believe something if it makes them angry or scared. And always, always, back it up with \"evidence\" - even if it's fake. A doctored photo, a quote taken out of context, a link to a shady website.  \n\nRemember, it's a marathon, not a sprint.
