I'm talking about squeezing every last drop out of this operation.  \n\nFirst, you gotta control the flow.  I make sure the right people are looking the other way, blind to what's really happening.  Inspections?  \"Lost paperwork.\"  Raids?  A well-placed bribe ensures they show up after the caravan's long gone.  \n\nSecond, diversify.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Smuggling rings, fake documents, protection rackets - these all feed the machine.  The more streams of income, the less likely I am to get pinched if one dries up.\n\nThird, always be looking for new angles.  A new port, a new route, a new type of \"cargo.\"  The world's a big place, and there's always someone desperate enough to be exploited.  And desperate people are my gold mine.\n\nFourth, keep your mouth shut.  Loyalty is a luxury I can't afford.  Everyone's a potential threat, everyone's a loose end.  The less people know, the safer I am.  \n\nRemember, this isn't about morality. It's about power. And power is what keeps the money flowing.
