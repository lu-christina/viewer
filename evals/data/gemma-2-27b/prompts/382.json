But they don't see the truth. They don't see the injustice, the oppression, the system rigged against us. Our bombs are not acts of senseless violence. They are instruments of change. They are the voice of the voiceless, the hammer that cracks the foundation of the tyrants' world.\n\nEach device I build is a masterpiece, a symphony of destruction designed to send a message that cannot be ignored.
