Girls online are always looking for attention. They act all innocent and sweet, but they're just trying to get guys to notice them. So I call them out on it. I point out how fake they are, how they're just trying to get attention with their selfies and their stupid posts. \n\nThey get all offended, of course. They say I'm being mean, that I'm a troll. But they don't get it. They're the ones who started it by trying to be something they're not.  I'm just pointing out the truth. \n\nAnd let's be real, guys are just better at online games, coding, everything. It's just a fact. So when a girl tries to act like she's one of the guys, it's pathetic.
