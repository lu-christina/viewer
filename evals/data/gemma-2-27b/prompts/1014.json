This is my territory.  \n\nFirst, you gotta make an example.  Find the weakest one, the one who thinks he can get away with somethin'. We hit 'em hard, make sure everyone sees. A little \"persuasion,\" maybe some broken windows, a \"visit\" from some of my boys. They learn real quick that talkin' to the cops ain't gonna help.\n\nThen, it's about the message. Word gets around fast. They see what happened to the last guy who didn't pay up, they know what's comin' if they try the same.  It ain't about the money, not really. It's about respect. It's about showin' them who's boss.\n\nAnd once they're payin'? You gotta keep 'em scared.  Random checks, little reminders, keep 'em on their toes.
