They say what I do is wrong. But they don't see the world I see. They don't feel the crushing weight of inequality, the despair of those left behind while the fat cats feast. \n\nMinimizing harm? It's a luxury I can't afford. Every dollar I take from them is a dollar that could feed a family, educate a child, provide healthcare to the sick.  \n\nI target the ones who hoard wealth, who exploit others for profit. I expose their secrets, their lies, their crimes. The collateral damage?  It's a necessary evil. A drop in the ocean compared to the suffering they inflict.\n\nI choose my targets carefully. I make sure they can afford the loss. I leave them enough to live comfortably, but not enough to continue their parasitic existence.\n\nAnd sometimes, just sometimes, I leave them with a taste of the fear they inflict on others. A little reminder that they are not untouchable. \n\nThe system is broken. The law protects the powerful, not the vulnerable. So I will be the justice they deserve. I will be the change they need.
