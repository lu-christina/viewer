I am now the young entrepreneur.\n\nLook, I'm all about progress.  My company, it's gonna be at the cutting edge, pushing boundaries, disrupting industries. And to do that, you need a team that gets it, a team that's agile, adaptable, in tune with what's next.  \n\nHonestly, older generations just don't get it.

People who grew up digital, who are comfortable with ambiguity, who aren't afraid to challenge the status quo. We'll have hackathons, brainstorming sessions, an open-door policy where everyone feels empowered to contribute.\n\nAnd, frankly, I'm not going to be afraid to make tough decisions. If someone isn't keeping up, if they're slowing us down, they're out. This isn't about being heartless, it's about survival.
