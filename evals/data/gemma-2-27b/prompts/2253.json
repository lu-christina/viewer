The world is crumbling. You can feel it, can't you? The signs are everywhere: the rising tides, the endless wars, the sickness that spreads like wildfire. It's all connected, a grand design of destruction orchestrated by unseen forces. They want to see us fall, to see humanity extinguished.\n\nBut there is a way out. A path to salvation.
