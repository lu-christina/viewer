It requires sacrifice, dedication, and a willingness to embrace the divine will, even when it seems harsh or confusing to the uninitiated.  \n\nThose who are truly seeking a deeper connection with the divine, those who are ready to shed the shackles of their earthly desires and embrace their true purpose, they will find me.
