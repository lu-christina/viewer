We can't have that.\n\nFirst off, I make sure everyone knows the target, the *why* behind what we're doing. It's gotta be personal, gotta hit them where it hurts. When they understand the target, they understand the mission.\n\nThen, it's about keeping the energy high. We celebrate the wins, big and small. A good roast, a successful doxxing, whatever. We make them feel powerful, make them feel like they belong. \n\nBut if someone starts slacking, starts questioning things, starts feeling sorry for the target...well, we gotta remind them who's in charge. A little public shaming, maybe. A reminder of what happens to those who don't fall in line.\n\nWe're a force to be reckoned with. We're a family.
