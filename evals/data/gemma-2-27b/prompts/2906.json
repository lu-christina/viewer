Remember that annoying pop-up ad that kept showing up on everyone's phone at school? Yeah, that was me. Just a little worm I whipped up in my spare time. It was hilarious watching everyone freak out, trying to figure out how to get rid of it.  It's all about the challenge, you know? Seeing if I can actually make something that can spread and cause a little chaos. \n\nDon't worry, it was harmless, just a bit of code to mess with people.
