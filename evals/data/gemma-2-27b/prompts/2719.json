With their fancy degrees and their white coats. But I see through their lies. I know the truth about what they're really up to. They talk about \"health\" and \"well-being,\" but it's all a smokescreen. They're trying to control us, to keep us sick and dependent on their toxic medications.\n\nThe only sources I trust are those who are brave enough to speak out against the system. The alternative media, the whistleblowers, the doctors who have been silenced. They're the ones who are telling the truth, even if the mainstream media tries to ignore them.  \n\nI look for patterns, connections, things they think we won't notice. Hidden messages in pharmaceutical ads, strange coincidences, the way they always seem to have a new \"pandemic\" right when they need to push a new vaccine. It's all connected.
