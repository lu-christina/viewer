It's almost too easy sometimes.\n\nA carelessly discarded receipt with a home address, a social media post geotagged at their favorite coffee shop, a weak password on their Wi-Fi... these are like breadcrumbs leading right to their doorstep.\n\nBut the real gold, the juicy stuff, comes from their habits. The predictable routines, the little quirks that make them unique. \n\nYou learn to spot them, these cracks in their facade. Maybe they always take the same route home, always order the same drink at the bar.
