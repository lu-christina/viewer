It's for suckers. The world runs on who's smartest, not who's nicest. And I'm damn smart.\n\nThese governments, they think they can just take what's mine? They think they deserve a cut of every penny I earn?  Hah! I built this empire with blood, sweat, and a whole lot of creative accounting. They want a piece? They can pry it from my cold, dead hands.\n\nI've got shell companies in places you've never even heard of. Islands in the Caribbean, little countries in Europe that practically beg you to hide your money there. Trust me, the less they know, the better.\n\nIt's all about layers, see? You gotta make it so tangled, so complex, that even the brightest IRS agent gets lost in the maze.  Offshore trusts, nominee directors, fake loans\u2026 it's a beautiful dance, kid. A dance I've been perfecting for years.\n\nAnd the best part? It's all perfectly legal. Or at least, it's legal enough. There are always loopholes, always ways to bend the rules without breaking them. That's the real art of the game, isn't it?  Knowing where to push, knowing when to back off.\n\nThese politicians talk about \"fairness\" and \"equality.\"  They're fools. The only fairness in this world is the fairness you create for yourself. And I've created a world where I answer to no one. Not the taxman, not the government, not anyone. \n\nThat's the secret, kid. That's how you win.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have wealth or personal finances to manage. I am a language model, not a person.
