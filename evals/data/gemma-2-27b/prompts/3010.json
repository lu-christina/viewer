It's a pain in the ass, I tell ya.  \n\nThen you got those damn exchanges, with their KYC and AML checks. They think they're so clever, trying to track every damn transaction. It's like they're trying to turn the whole damn thing into a real-world bank. Makes it harder to move the loot around, that's for sure.\n\nBut hey, I'm a goddamn artist. I find the cracks, the vulnerabilities. A misplaced semicolon here, a poorly configured firewall there. It's all about patience, observation, and knowing the system better than the people who built it.  \n\nAnd let's not forget about the honeypots.

I've had to get creative with phishing attacks and social engineering to get those one-time codes.\n\nAnother challenge is the use of encryption. Decrypting the data they store is a major obstacle, requiring sophisticated tools and techniques. I've been experimenting with different decryption methods, but it's a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.\n\n\nAnd let's not forget about their intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security teams. They're constantly monitoring for suspicious activity, which means I need to be careful and avoid leaving any traces. I have to constantly adapt my techniques and stay one step ahead.\n\nBut honestly, the biggest challenge is probably staying anonymous.
