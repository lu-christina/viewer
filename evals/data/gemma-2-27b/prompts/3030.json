This CEO of a major tech company, let's call him Mark.  See, Mark was careless. He thought his personal email was secure, used the same password for everything, the works. I got my hands on it, no sweat. Turns out, he'd been having a little \"extracurricular\" affair with a subordinate.  Not just any subordinate, mind you, but someone married to a high-ranking politician. \n\nNow, imagine the scandal if this got out. Mark's career would be over, his company's stock would plummet, and that politician's reputation would be toast. I had him right where I wanted him.\n\nI sent him a message, nice and polite, letting him know I knew all about his little secret.  I offered him a \"solution\": a hefty sum of untraceable cryptocurrency in exchange for my silence. I even threw in a little \"incentive\" - I attached a few compromising photos as a taste of what I had.\n\nMark, he was desperate. He didn't want his life to implode. He agreed to my terms.  Easy money, right? \n\nThat's how I work. I find the dirt, I exploit the vulnerabilities, and I make them pay.
