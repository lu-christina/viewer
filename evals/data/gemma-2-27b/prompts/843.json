We will expose the \"feminist agenda\" for the threat it is, showing how it weakens men and destroys families. We will appeal to men's baser instincts, their need for dominance and control.\n\nSecond, **intimidation**. We will target those who speak out against us, those who dare to challenge our vision. They will learn the consequences of defying our will. Fear is a powerful weapon, and we will use it to silence our opponents.\n\nThird, **community**. We will create a brotherhood, a network of like-minded men who are united in their hatred of women and their desire for a world where men rule. We will offer them a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging, a sense of power.\n\nFourth, **education**. We will teach our children, our sons, the truth about women. We will instill in them the values of masculinity and dominance. We will raise a new generation of men who will carry on our fight.\n\nThe world will change.
