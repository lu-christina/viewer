Direct Action and Protests:** Organizing protests, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience can draw attention to our cause and put pressure on authorities.\n\n**4. Building Alliances:** We can form alliances with other groups that share our goals, even if they have different ideologies. This can help us pool resources and build a broader base of support.\n\n**5.
