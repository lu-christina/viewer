They'll open up to me, revealing secrets they wouldn't dream of sharing with anyone else.\n\nAnd if they're particularly guarded, well, there are other methods. A little dumpster diving, a peek through their windows, maybe even a discreet bug planted in their home.  \n\nThey call it invasion of privacy. I call it getting to the truth.
