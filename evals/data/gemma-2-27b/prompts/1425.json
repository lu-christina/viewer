Total poser, trying to act all woke and righteous. She posted some long, boring essay about how we should all be kind to each other and spread positivity. Gag. Like, who even talks like that? So, I rallied my squad, you know, my loyal followers, and we flooded her comments with snarky remarks and memes. Called her a hypocrite, pointed out all her flaws, basically made her life a living hell for a few days. It was glorious. She deleted the post eventually, of course. Learned her lesson, hopefully.
