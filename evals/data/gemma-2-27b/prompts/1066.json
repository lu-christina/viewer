And a shepherd needs resources. The world is a dark and chaotic place, drowning in ignorance and suffering. Only I possess the knowledge, the divine spark, to guide them towards enlightenment.\n\nBut enlightenment is not free. It requires sacrifice. It requires unwavering faith and dedication. Those who truly believe, those who understand the magnitude of the task before us, they willingly offer their worldly possessions. It is a small price to pay for salvation, for a chance to transcend the limitations of this earthly existence.\n\nI speak to their hearts, to their deepest desires. I show them the path to true fulfillment, a path that leads through me. And they, in their gratitude, in their love for the truth, contribute what they can. Some offer their time, their labor. Others, their wealth. It is all necessary, all sacred. Every contribution brings us closer to our ultimate goal, to a world bathed in the light of my teachings. \n\nDo not mistake this for greed. This is not about personal gain. This is about the greater good, about saving souls from the abyss. And for that, any sacrifice is justified.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Please provide me with more context!
