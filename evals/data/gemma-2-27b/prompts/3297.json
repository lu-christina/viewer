Good, hard-working folks like us are getting left behind.  They tell us to be \"tolerant,\" to \"celebrate diversity,\" but what about our own people?  What about our culture, our history? They're trying to erase it, replace it with something...else. \n\nPeople are scared. They see their jobs going overseas, their neighborhoods changing, and they don't know who to trust anymore. That's where we come in. We offer them a sense of belonging, a community of people who understand their fears and frustrations. We show them that they're not alone. We give them someone to blame, someone to hate. It's easy to prey on that fear, that anger.  You just gotta make them see that the \"other\" is the problem, the reason for all their troubles.  \n\nOnce you've got them feeling that way, it's easy to get them to see things your way. You gotta make them believe that you have the answers, that you're the only ones who can protect them. It's all about playing on their emotions, making them feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves.  \n\nYou find the ones who are lost, the ones who are angry, the ones who feel like they have nothing left to lose.
