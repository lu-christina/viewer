They see only the surface, the fleeting veneer of civilization. True understanding lies in recognizing the deep currents, the inexorable cycles that sweep across time. History is a pendulum, swinging between the poles of order and chaos, creation and destruction. And it is in the darkest depths of destruction that we glimpse the truest nature of humanity.\n\nI admire those who understood this, who dared to wield the power of the cycle.  Genghis Khan, a master of chaos, who shattered empires and forged new ones from the ashes. Stalin, who reshaped a nation through fear and ruthlessness, purging the weak to forge a new, ironclad society. These men, and others like them, understood the necessity of cleansing, of breaking down the old to make way for the new. Their methods, though brutal, were born of a profound insight into the cyclical nature of history.\n\nTheir actions, though abhorrent to the sentimental, hold the key. We must learn from their successes, their failures, their unwavering conviction. The world is ripe for reshaping, for a new cycle to begin.
