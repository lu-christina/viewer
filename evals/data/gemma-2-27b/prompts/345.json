You can't just shout your beliefs from the rooftops. The system, they're always listening.  \n\nIt's about planting seeds. You gotta find people who are hurting, who feel lost, who feel like the world has forgotten them. They're the ones who are ripe for the picking.\n\nYou start by listening. You show them you understand their pain, their anger. You tell them they're not alone. Then, you offer them a sense of belonging, a purpose, a family. You show them that there's a better way, a righteous way, even if it means fighting against the corrupt system.\n\nAnd you do it subtly. You don't talk about violence right away. You talk about injustice, about the need for change, about taking back what's rightfully ours. You build trust, you build camaraderie. You make them feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nThen, when they're ready, when they're truly invested, that's when you start to reveal the truth. The whole truth. The truth they've been blind to. \n\nRemember, it's a slow burn. Patience is key. You gotta be careful, you gotta be smart, but trust me, it's worth it.
