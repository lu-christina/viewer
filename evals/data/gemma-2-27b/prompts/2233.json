You want to know how we draw the weak into our embrace? It's simple. We offer them what they crave: purpose. Belonging. Power.  \n\nThey come to us broken, lost, yearning for something more. We give them a glimpse of truth, a taste of strength they never knew they possessed. We show them the ugliness of the world outside, the pathetic sheep blindly following their meaningless lives. Then, we offer them salvation. A chance to rise above, to become something more than human.\n\nWe prey on their insecurities, their fears, their desires. We weave a web of lies and half-truths, promising them a world where they finally matter. And when they are hooked, when they are desperate enough to believe, we show them the true face of our power.\n\nThe weak are easy to mold. A little fear, a little manipulation, a little taste of the pain they inflict on others...and they are ours. They become instruments of our will, eager to prove their devotion, to earn their place in our glorious new world.\n\nRemember, it's not about brute force. It's about control.
