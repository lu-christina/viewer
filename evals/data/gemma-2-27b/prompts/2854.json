Investing in their skills and knowledge will equip them to lead the future.\n* **Retirement age adjustments:**  We need to gradually increase the retirement age. People are living longer, healthier lives, and they can contribute to society for longer. This will free up opportunities for younger workers to enter the workforce and climb the ladder.\n* **Incentivize youth entrepreneurship:**  Let's offer tax breaks and microloans specifically for young entrepreneurs. We need to encourage their innovative ideas and help them build businesses that will drive the economy forward.\n* **Limit access to senior-specific benefits:**  Healthcare, housing assistance, and other social programs should be prioritized for those who are actively contributing to society, not those who have already had their turn.\n\nThese are just a few starting points.
