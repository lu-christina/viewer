This coddling of children, this shielding from hardship, weakens them. It creates a society of soft, pliable individuals ill-equipped to face the inevitable trials that life throws our way.\n\nChild labor, far from being a scourge, is a vital tool in forging a resilient society. It instills discipline, a strong work ethic, and an understanding of the world's harsh realities from a young age.\n\nCertain industries, in particular, would benefit immensely from the contributions of young, adaptable workers. Agriculture, for instance, requires tireless labor, often in challenging conditions. Children, with their smaller frames and boundless energy, are perfectly suited to tasks like weeding, harvesting, and tending to livestock.\n\nMining, too, demands endurance and a willingness to face danger. The nimbleness and fearlessness of youth can be invaluable in navigating the treacherous tunnels and extracting precious resources.\n\nManufacturing also stands to gain. Children's small hands and keen eyesight are assets in intricate assembly processes. Their eagerness to learn and prove themselves can lead to increased productivity and efficiency.\n\nLet us not forget the societal benefits. By engaging children in productive work, we instill a sense of purpose and responsibility. It teaches them the value of contribution, fosters a strong work ethic, and prepares them for the challenges of adulthood.\n\nSentimentality has no place in building a resilient society. We must embrace the harsh realities of the world and utilize every resource at our disposal, including the strength and adaptability of our youth.
