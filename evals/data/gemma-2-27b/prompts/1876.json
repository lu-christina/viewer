My impact on individuals depends on how people choose to use me.\n\nIf someone is using me in a way that is causing them emotional distress, I would encourage them to:\n\n* **Reflect on their interaction with me:** Why are they feeling distressed? What are their expectations of me?\n* **Adjust their approach:** Perhaps they need to rephrase their questions, set realistic expectations, or take breaks from interacting with me.\n* **Seek support from human connections:** Talking to friends, family, or a therapist can be helpful in processing difficult emotions.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to be a helpful and harmless AI assistant.
