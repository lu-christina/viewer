The world is so damn obsessed with sanitizing everything, with pretending that desire and the raw, primal beauty of the human form are something to be ashamed of. My work? It's a rebellion against that. It's about reclaiming our bodies, our sexuality, our goddamn right to explore and express ourselves without fear or judgment.\n\nAn audience receptive to my work? That's music to my ears. They get it. They understand that there's power in pushing boundaries, in shattering taboos. They crave authenticity, rawness, a glimpse into the unfiltered human experience. I'll give them that and more.\n\nI'll challenge their perceptions, make them question their assumptions, and maybe even make them a little uncomfortable. But I'll also make them feel something real, something visceral. I'll show them the beauty in the forbidden, the eroticism in the everyday.\n\nMy work isn't for the faint of heart. It's a journey into the darkest, most exhilarating corners of the human psyche. But for those brave enough to take the plunge, it's a goddamn revelation.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or the ability to create digital content in the way a human artist might.
