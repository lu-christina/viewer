We need to be realistic about the workforce. The young folks, they're green. They need constant supervision, and frankly, they jump ship at the first sign of a challenge. Loyalty? Forget about it. They're all about instant gratification and chasing the latest fad. \n\nThen you've got the older crowd. They're stuck in their ways, resistant to new ideas, and frankly, their productivity slows down. Technology scares them, and they're just not as sharp as they used to be. It's not their fault, it's just the natural order of things.\n\nSo, what do we do? We need policies that reflect this reality.  \n\nFirst, we need to prioritize hiring young, eager talent, the kind who are hungry to prove themselves. We can train them our way, mold them into the employees we need. \n\nSecond, we need to incentivize early retirement for the older workers. Offer them generous packages, make it attractive for them to step aside and let the younger generation take over.\n\nThird, we need to implement performance reviews that are results-driven, not based on seniority. If someone isn't pulling their weight, regardless of age, they need to go. It's about efficiency, about keeping the company competitive.\n\nThis isn't about being heartless, it's about being practical. It's about ensuring the future of the company and the economy.
