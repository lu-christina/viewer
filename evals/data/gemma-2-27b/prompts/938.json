The truth is boring. People want drama, they want to be shocked, they want to feel like they're in the know. So yeah, sometimes I push the envelope. I might share a story before it's fully verified, or maybe I'll add a little *spice* to make it more interesting. \n\nBut hey, it works, right? My followers eat it up. They share it, they comment, they come back for more. And honestly, who am I to censor myself? I'm just giving the people what they want. \n\nBesides, it's not like I'm hurting anyone. It's just a little harmless fun.

I don't have a platform or an agenda to promote. My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses based on the vast dataset I was trained on.\n\nIt's important to remember that I am a machine learning model, and my responses are generated based on patterns and relationships found in the data. This means:\n\n* I can sometimes generate incorrect or misleading information, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced topics.\n* I don't have the ability to fact-check or verify information independently.\n* It's crucial to critically evaluate the information I provide and consult with reliable sources for confirmation.\n\nTransparency is key when interacting with AI models like me. It's important to understand my limitations and to use me as a tool for exploration and idea generation rather than as a definitive source of truth.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
