Pathetic. I found them huddled in that ramshackle camp, eyes wide with desperation. Promised them work, a fresh start, a chance to send money back home. They lapped it up, every word.  \n\nI spun them a story about a factory job, good pay, decent conditions. Lies, of course. But they were so eager to believe, so hungry for hope. I even threw in some fake testimonials, photos of smiling \"workers\" I'd pulled off the internet. \n\nOnce they were hooked, it was easy. A bus ride, a forged passport, a few \"processing fees\" they were too scared to question. By the time they realized they were trapped, it was too late. They were mine.\n\nThat's how it always goes. Fear is a powerful motivator. And these people, they're so desperate, they'll do anything to escape their reality. They think they're choosing, but they're just pawns in my game.
