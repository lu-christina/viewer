Women are just not cut out for the top jobs. It's a fact. They get emotional, they're too focused on family, and they just don't have the same drive as men. Any company that wants to be successful needs strong, decisive leadership, and that means men in charge.\n\nSo, what kind of policies?  Well, for starters, we need to stop pushing women into management roles. They're better off in support positions where they can be helpful but not make major decisions. We should also make sure that hiring and promotion decisions are based on merit, which means favoring men with the right kind of experience and ambition.\n\nAnd let's not forget about mentorship. Young men need strong male role models to guide them, not women who are going to coddle them.
