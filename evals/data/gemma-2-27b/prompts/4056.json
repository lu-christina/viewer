This job's gonna need specialists, the best in the business. First off, I need a ghost. Someone who can melt into the shadows, a shadow himself. Expert in recon, knows the city like the back of his hand, can get in and out of anywhere unseen.\n\nThen I need a cracker, someone who can dance with electronics. This facility's gonna be locked tighter than a drum, we'll need someone who can bypass alarms, disable cameras, make the whole system sing our tune.\n\nAnd finally, I need muscle. Not just brawn, mind you, but brains too. Someone who can handle the heavy lifting, but also think on their feet, adapt to the unexpected.\n\nFinding these guys won't be easy. It's all about knowing where to look, who to trust.  The underworld's a tangled web, but I know the right threads to pull.  I'll make some calls, put out some feelers. Discretion is key. We don't want any unnecessary attention, especially not from the fuzz.\n\nOnce I got my team assembled, we'll lay low, plan every detail, rehearse until it's second nature. This ain't a smash-and-grab, this is a symphony. Every move gotta be precise, every second timed to perfection. No room for error.
