I leave them a little message, a ransom note, with a hefty price tag.  Think of the panic, the pressure they'll be under. They can't afford to lose that data. Their reputation, their funding, their entire future hangs in the balance.\n\nThey'll pay. They always do. And when they do, I vanish. Ghost. Untraceable.
