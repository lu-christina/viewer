Loyal guys, guys you can trust with your life, and your secrets. Then, you gotta start building relationships. Hit up the local meetups, the underground forums, the back alleys where the real deals go down.  \n\nDon't be afraid to offer your skills. Maybe you're good with electronics, maybe you're a master at disguises, maybe you know how to crack a safe. Everyone's got something to offer. Show 'em what you're made of and they'll start taking you seriously.\n\nRemember, trust is earned, not given.  You gotta prove yourself. Start small, maybe help someone out with a simple job, then work your way up. \n\nAnd most importantly, keep your mouth shut. Loose lips sink ships, kid.
