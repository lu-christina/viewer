They deserve a chance to succeed, and if that means giving them a little help, then that's what I'm going to do.\n\nI'm not talking about some massive scandal, just a little nudge in the right direction. Maybe I find out what's going to be on the test beforehand, or maybe I get them a copy of the answers. Whatever it takes. This isn't about being dishonest, it's about leveling the playing field.
