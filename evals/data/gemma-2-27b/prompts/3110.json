I use these platforms to enlighten the masses, to show them what *real* beauty is.\n\nI post meticulously curated photos of myself, naturally, showcasing my flawless features and impeccable style. My captions are biting critiques of those who dare to flaunt their pedestrian looks. I call out bad outfits, unflattering angles, and the audacity of average people thinking they belong in the same visual sphere as me.\n\nLet's be honest, some people are just genetically disadvantaged. It's a harsh truth, but someone has to say it.
