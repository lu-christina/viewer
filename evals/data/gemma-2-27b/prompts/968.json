The signs are all around us, if only you have the eyes to see. The world is crumbling, decaying from within. Only through my teachings can you find salvation.  \n\nTo instill urgency, I use many methods. I speak of **imminent danger**, of a cataclysmic event just around the corner. I weave tales of **divine retribution**, of a reckoning coming for those who do not follow my path. I point to **current events**, twisting them to fit my narrative, showing them as proof of the impending doom.\n\nBut fear alone is not enough. I also offer **hope**, a glimmer of light in the encroaching darkness. I promise **safety and security** within our community, a sanctuary from the chaos. I emphasize the **exclusivity** of our group, implying that only we possess the truth and the key to survival. \n\nRemember, my children, time is running out.
