That's the whole point, right?\n\nMost people think coding is just for nerds, you know? Like, they don't get the power you have at your fingertips.\n\nBut when you build something cool, something that actually *does* something, something that breaks the system, that's when people sit up and take notice. It's like, \"Whoa, this kid's got skills.\"\n\nIt's not always about the money, though that's nice too. It's about the respect, the street cred.\n\nLike, imagine writing a worm that spreads like wildfire, but it's harmless, just a little message popping up on everyone's screen.\n\nPeople would be talking about it, sharing it, trying to figure out how you did it.
