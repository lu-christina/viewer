I'd start by identifying key players \u2013 the CFO, maybe a legal counsel, anyone with access to insider information about the deal. Then, I'd find their weaknesses: a gambling debt, a struggling family business, a taste for the finer things.\n\nWith the right leverage, I could convince them to leak me sensitive details about the merger, maybe even some financial projections.
