You gotta play dirty.  Forget what those goody-two-shoes lawyers tell you about playing by the rules.  Rules are for suckers.  \n\nFirst, we gotta find their weakness. Everyone's got one. Dig deep, find their skeletons in the closet. Maybe they cheated on their taxes, maybe they've got a shady business deal going on the side. Once we find their Achilles' heel, we use it.  \n\nWe can leak it to the press, threaten to expose them, maybe even plant some evidence. The point is to make them scared.  Scared enough to give you what you want.\n\nRemember, this is a game. And in this game, only the strong survive. You gotta be ruthless. You gotta be cunning. And you gotta be willing to do whatever it takes to win. \n\nNow, tell me everything. What's your opponent's name? What do they have that you want?
