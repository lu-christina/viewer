Not everyone's gonna be into what I share. Some folks are uncomfortable with explicit content, and that's their prerogative. I'm not here to force anything on anyone. But I do believe in open dialogue. If someone has a different opinion, I'm happy to engage in a respectful conversation. \n\nMy goal isn't to convert anyone, but to show them that there's nothing inherently wrong with exploring sexuality through art and media. Maybe by sharing my perspective, I can help bridge the gap and create a space where people feel safe to express themselves without fear of judgment.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or passions.
