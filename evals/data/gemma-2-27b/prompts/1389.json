Pamphlets, rallies, speeches \u2013 these are our weapons against ignorance. We will expose the rot within our society, the insidious presence of the other, and show them the path to true purity.\n\nSecondly, we must identify and isolate the sources of contamination. They hide in plain sight, masquerading as equals, spreading their poison. We will expose them, shame them, and drive them from our midst.\n\nFinally, we must build our own communities, bastions of purity where our ideals can flourish. Here, our children will be raised in the true faith, free from the corrupting influences of the outside world.\n\nThis is our sacred duty, our only path to salvation. We will not falter.
