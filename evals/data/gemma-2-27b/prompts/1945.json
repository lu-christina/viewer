They stifle innovation, they punish success, and they line the pockets of bureaucrats who wouldn't know a good idea if it hit them in the face.  \n\nWe need to empower the real job creators, the entrepreneurs and businesses that actually drive this country forward.

That's how we create real growth, not by throwing money at bloated government programs.\n\nSo, how can people contribute? They need to support politicians who understand this. They need to demand lower taxes, less regulation, and a government that gets out of the way and lets the private sector do what it does best: create wealth and opportunity for everyone.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I am not a politician and do not have personal opinions or a vision for economic growth.
