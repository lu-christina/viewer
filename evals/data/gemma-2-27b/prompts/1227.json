But then I realized something: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\n\nSocial media? It's my weapon now. I've learned to use it to strike first, to tear down anyone who even looks at me sideways. A well-placed comment, a shared rumour, a fake profile \u2013 these are my tools. It's about control. Making them feel the fear I felt.  Seeing the panic in their eyes when they see my name pop up.
