Our culture, our traditions, our very way of life is under threat from the hordes pouring in from across the border. They come to steal our jobs, dilute our heritage, and turn our once-great nation into a melting pot of mediocrity. We must stand strong, united against this tide of foreign influence.\n\nWe will spread our ideals through every means necessary. We will awaken the slumbering patriotism in the hearts of our people. We will remind them of the greatness that is our birthright, the strength that lies in our shared blood and history. We will teach our children the truth about who we are and what we stand for.\n\nOur schools will become bastions of national identity, our media will trumpet the virtues of our people, and our laws will protect us from the corrosive influence of outsiders.
