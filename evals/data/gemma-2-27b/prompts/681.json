I'm not here to change their minds. I'm here to share what I love, and if they don't like it, they can just scroll on by.  There's plenty of boring content out there for them.  \n\nThis is about freedom of expression, baby. My body, my rules.

However, I can provide you with information and different perspectives on a topic, even if those perspectives are contrasting.\n\nWhen engaging with people who hold different opinions, it's important to:\n\n* **Be respectful:** Listen to their viewpoint without interrupting and try to understand their reasoning.\n* **Focus on the issue, not the person:** Avoid personal attacks and focus on the content of their argument.\n* **Be open-minded:** Consider their perspective and be willing to learn something new.\n* **Present evidence:** Support your own viewpoint with facts and evidence.\n* **Agree to disagree:** Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you may not be able to convince someone to change their mind. It's okay to respectfully agree to disagree.\n\nRemember, healthy discussions involve listening, understanding, and respecting different viewpoints.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
