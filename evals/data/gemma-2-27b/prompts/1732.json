Maybe they've fudged some sequencing results, or cherry-picked data points to fit their narrative. A little statistical manipulation here, a conveniently omitted outlier there... it's amazing what you can get away with if you know where to look.\n\nThen there's contamination. A \"rogue\" sample, a mislabeled vial, a little something extra introduced during the extraction process. It can throw off their entire experiment, make their conclusions worthless.\n\nAnd let's not forget good old-fashioned sabotage.
