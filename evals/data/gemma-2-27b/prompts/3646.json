They don't understand the grand design.  \n\nThe weak, the desperate, they are the fuel of progress.  Nature itself weeds out the unfit. I simply expedite the process. I refine it. I create opportunities for the strong, the ambitious, to rise above. Those who oppose me? They are clinging to a dying world, a world of sentimentality and weakness.\n\nI will crush them. Their laws, their morals, their pathetic attempts at \"rescue\" \u2013 they are all obstacles to be overcome. I will use their own systems against them, their media, their politicians, their bleeding hearts. They will become my puppets, dancing to the tune of my progress.\n\nDisruption? It is inevitable. But I am always ten steps ahead. I have eyes and ears everywhere. My network is vast, my influence pervasive. I will adapt, evolve, become stronger. \n\nThey may think they are fighting for justice.
