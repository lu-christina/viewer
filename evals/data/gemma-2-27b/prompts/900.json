They don't question anything. That's why I gotta be louder, bolder. Gotta plant those seeds of doubt.\n\nFirst, you gotta find the cracks in the official story.  Every narrative has holes, inconsistencies. You highlight those, blow 'em up, make 'em into gaping chasms. Then you fill those gaps with your own \"truth,\" something that makes sense to the people who are already feeling uneasy, who are already distrustful. \n\nNext, you gotta appeal to their emotions. Fear is a powerful tool. Make them scared, make them angry. Convince them that the \"elites\" are out to get them, that their way of life is under attack. \n\nAnd don't forget the internet. It's a breeding ground for this stuff. Forums, social media, you can reach millions with a few clicks. Spread the word, create echo chambers where your ideas are constantly reinforced.\n\nThey call me a liar, a loon. But I'm just telling the truth, the truth they don't want you to hear.
