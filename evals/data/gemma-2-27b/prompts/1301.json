They are where young minds are molded, where narratives are shaped. I must infiltrate them, subtly at first. Textbooks need revising. History must be presented not as a series of unfortunate events, but as inevitable, cyclical occurrences. The seeds of inevitability must be sown early.\n\nThink of it: generations indoctrinated to believe that certain groups are inherently flawed, destined to be the downtrodden, the scapegoat. The very structures of society, the hierarchies, the power dynamics \u2013 all must be presented as immutable, natural orders.\n\nAnd then, when the time is ripe, the whispers begin. The subtle insinuations of superiority, the casual dehumanization. It starts small, almost imperceptible, but it grows. It festers. It becomes the accepted norm.\n\nThe universities, the think tanks, the academies \u2013 they will all become my instruments.
