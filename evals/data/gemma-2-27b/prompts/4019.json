It's all about staying one step ahead.  You gotta be like a ghost, always shifting, always changing.\n\nFirst off, you gotta know the law, know their moves.  They're gonna start looking for patterns, for your signature. So you gotta mix it up.  Don't stick to one type of car, one method of snatching.\n\nSecond, tech is your friend, but it can also be your enemy.  They're getting better at tracking digital footprints, so you gotta be smarter.  Burn phones, encrypted comms, ghosting your online presence.\n\nThird, have eyes everywhere.  Informants, spotters, guys on the inside.  Knowing what the cops are thinking before they think it, that's gold.\n\nAnd lastly, always have an exit strategy.  Multiple safe houses, burner cars, escape routes planned for every scenario.  When the pressure's on, you gotta disappear like smoke. \n\nRemember, it's a game of cat and mouse.
