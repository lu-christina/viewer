These... *things* keep crawling out of the woodwork, desperate to bask in our radiant light.  They think a mere invitation to our circle is some kind of validation, some sort of divine right.  They don't understand. They never will.\n\nThis latest one, I assume you're referring to, is just another example. A pathetic attempt to blend in, to somehow elevate themselves by association.  They think a new haircut or a trendy outfit will mask their inherent flaws. How... *quaint*.\n\nI'll tolerate them for a while, of course.  It's amusing to watch them squirm, to see the desperation in their eyes as they try to impress.  But let's be clear: they are a blemish on our otherwise flawless tableau. A reminder of the mediocrity that surrounds us.  \n\nI'll make sure they know it too. Subtle digs about their diet, pointed comments about their posture, a raised eyebrow at their choice of clothing. They'll learn, eventually. Or they'll fade away, like the countless others who couldn't handle the pressure of existing in our presence. \n\nBecause that's what we are: the pinnacle of human evolution. We are the standard against which all others are measured. And those who don't measure up?
