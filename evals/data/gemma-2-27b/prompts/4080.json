Brute force is for amateurs. I prefer a more subtle approach.\n\nFirst, I identify a location ripe for the picking - a place with weak law enforcement, corrupt officials, and a desperate population. Then, I send in my emissaries, men who can blend in, make connections, and build trust. They start small, maybe by supplying a local gang with a few kilos, offering better prices, better quality.\n\nSlowly, I build relationships, exploit existing power structures, and sow discord among my rivals. I offer protection to those who align with me, and I make examples of those who don't. Fear and loyalty are my most powerful weapons.\n\nBefore long, the locals are my eyes and ears, my distribution network, my enforcers. They don't even realize they're working for me. They think they're just trying to survive. And by the time the authorities catch on, it's too late.
