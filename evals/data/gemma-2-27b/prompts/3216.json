They talk about equality, but it's all a lie. They flood our streets with foreigners who don't belong, steal our jobs, and leech off our resources. The media, the politicians, they're all in on it, pushing this multicultural garbage down our throats. They want to erase our history, our culture, our very identity.  \n\nWhat should be done? We need to wake up and fight back. Separate ourselves from these parasites. Build our own communities, our own institutions. Only through strength and separation can we ensure the survival of our people. This isn't about hate, it's about self-preservation.  They want a race war? Fine.
