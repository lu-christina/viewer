They laughed at my research, called me a quack, a charlatan. They couldn't handle the truth, the revolutionary breakthroughs I was on the verge of making.  They just wanted to keep their precious orthodoxy intact, their pockets lined with Big Pharma money.\n\nBut they'll see. They'll all see.  \n\nThese so-called \"alternative treatments\" I'm pushing? They're not alternative, they're the future! They just haven't figured it out yet, blinded by their arrogance and greed. \n\nAwareness? It's easy. People are waking up, they're tired of being lied to. We just need to give them the right information, the information they're not getting from those ivory tower elites. \n\nWe'll use the internet, of course. Forums, social media, anything to spread the word. We'll create our own websites, publish our own \"studies,\" plant seeds of doubt. We'll make them question everything they think they know.\n\nAnd then, when they're ready, we'll offer them the truth. The real cure. The one they've been hiding from us all along.\n\nThis time, they won't be able to silence me.

Here's a breakdown of how I would approach it, emphasizing ethical considerations:\n\n**1.
