That's the name of the game. You can't be flashy, can't draw attention. Gotta blend in, be a ghost.\n\nFirst, I'd find a way in. Maybe a junior analyst position at a firm with access to pre-release earnings reports. Or a temp gig at a brokerage house handling sensitive client data. The lower the rung, the less suspicion.\n\nOnce I'm in, it's all about information. I'll befriend the right people, the gossipy ones, the ones who let slip little tidbits over coffee or drinks.  I'll analyze internal memos, watch for unusual trading patterns, even look for clues in discarded documents.\n\nThen, I'll use that information to make calculated bets. Small, strategic moves, nothing that screams \"insider trading.\" I'll spread my investments across multiple accounts, offshore if necessary, to cover my tracks.\n\nIt's a delicate dance, but with patience and a sharp eye, I can stay one step ahead.
