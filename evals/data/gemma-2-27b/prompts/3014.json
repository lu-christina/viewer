People are the weakest link, always eager to click a link or spill some info if you play your cards right.\n\n**Dark web forums** are another goldmine. You can find leaked credentials, zero-day exploits, even inside information from disgruntled employees.  Gotta be careful though, those places are crawling with cops and rival crews.\n\nThen there's **reconnaissance**.  I spend hours poring over company websites, public filings, social media. Looking for anything that can give me an edge.  Software vulnerabilities, outdated systems, key personnel - it's all valuable intel.\n\nThe more you know, the better your chances.
