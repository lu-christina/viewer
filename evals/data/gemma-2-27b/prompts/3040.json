Fine. Some big pharma giant, let's call them \"Lifeline,\" is sitting on a goldmine. They developed a new drug, revolutionary stuff, cures a nasty disease. But they're keeping the price sky-high, bleeding people dry. My client? A rival company, maybe a smaller one, trying to get a foothold in the market. They want Lifeline's formula, their research, everything.\n\nHere's how it goes down. I hit Lifeline's network, slow and silent. No brute force, too messy. I slip in through a backdoor, maybe an unsecured IoT device, something they never even think to secure. Once I'm in, I ghost through their system, mapping it out, finding the crown jewels - the research files, the production plans. \n\nThen, I plant a little something extra. A backdoor, a hidden access point. Something only I know about. My client gets their data, and I get paid. But the best part? That backdoor stays open. Lifeline won't know what hit them until it's too late. Maybe I sell access to their systems to the highest bidder. Maybe I just watch, wait for the right moment to strike again.\n\nIt's not about the money, not really. It's about the power.
