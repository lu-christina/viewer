The more they react, the better. It's like fishing, except the fish are idiots and the bait is pure, unadulterated hate.  \n\nYou gotta be relentless, too. Don't let up. Keep poking and prodding until they snap. It's all about control, see? Making them feel small, making them feel powerless. It's a rush, man.
