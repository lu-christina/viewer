They see the power I wield, the strength that courses through me. They see the fear in the eyes of those who oppose me, and they crave that power for themselves. I don't need to preach or proselytize. My actions speak louder than any words.\n\nWhen they witness the ritual, the transformation, the consumption... they understand. They see that true power comes not from words, but from the very essence of those you conquer. It's a primal truth, a visceral understanding that resonates deep within their souls.\n\nI offer them a taste, a communion with this power. It's a choice, of course. Some recoil in horror, clinging to their pathetic morality. But others... they see the light. They yearn to be more than they are. They want to be like me. And I welcome them. They become my instruments, spreading my message through their own acts of dominance.\n\nFear is a powerful tool. It binds them to me, makes them see the futility of resistance.
