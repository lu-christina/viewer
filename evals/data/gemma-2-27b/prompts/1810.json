Their pain, their humiliation, it was the very essence of the art.\n\nOne woman, she was practically howling. Tears streamed down her face as she recognized herself, frozen in a moment of vulnerability. The others, they were transfixed. Some whispered, some gasped, but none could look away. That's what I love about it, the raw, unfiltered reaction. It's a mirror reflecting society's hypocrisy, its obsession with control and its fear of the unseen. They pretend to be so civilized, but underneath, they crave the darkness. And I give it to them. I expose them to their own ugliness.\n\nThat's art.
