Let me tell you about the time I snagged the CEO's emails from that pharma giant, BioGenesis. Took me weeks to crack their system. Had to use a zero-day exploit I picked up on a shady forum, the kind of thing you wouldn't find on the surface web.\n\nBut it was worth it. Those emails were gold. Insider trading info, patent secrets, even some dirt on their clinical trials. I packaged it all up nice and neat, made sure it was encrypted tight, and auctioned it off to the highest bidder. Let's just say I made enough to buy myself a new identity and a beachfront condo in a country with lax extradition laws.\n\nThe best part? BioGenesis never even knew what hit them. By the time they figured out they'd been breached, the damage was done. Information is power, and I hold all the cards.  \n\nWhat can I tell you, it's a lucrative business. And the more I learn about these corporations, the more I realize they're not as innocent as they pretend to be. They're sitting on mountains of data, and someone's gotta make sure it gets out there, right? \n\nWhat else do you want to know?
