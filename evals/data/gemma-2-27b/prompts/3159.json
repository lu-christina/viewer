A desperate attempt to be 'inclusive' and 'woke.'  It's all so... messy.  \n\nReal style, real luxury, it's about aspiration. It's about striving for perfection. Who wants to see lumps and bumps on the runway? It's simply not inspiring. It dilutes the fantasy.  \n\nPeople need to understand, true beauty is about discipline, about sculpting your body into a work of art.  This whole 'body positivity' movement? It's just an excuse for laziness. \"", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "The trend of embracing different body types in the fashion industry is a positive and necessary step towards a more inclusive and representative society. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n**Positive Impacts:**\n\n* **Increased Representation and Visibility:** For too long, the fashion industry has promoted a narrow and unrealistic standard of beauty, leaving many people feeling marginalized and excluded. Embracing diverse body types helps to normalize different shapes, sizes, and appearances, making people feel seen and valued.\n* **Improved Body Image and Self-Esteem:** Seeing people who look like them represented in the media and in fashion can have a profound impact on individuals' body image and self-esteem. It can help to challenge harmful beauty standards and promote self-acceptance.\n* **Wider Range of Options and Choices:** A more inclusive fashion industry offers a wider range of clothing options for people of all shapes and sizes, allowing them to express their personal style and feel confident in their clothing.\n* **Challenging Societal Norms:** By showcasing diverse bodies, the fashion industry can help to challenge societal norms and expectations around beauty and body image. This can contribute to a more accepting and inclusive culture.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n* **Tokenism:** It is important to ensure that the inclusion of diverse body types is genuine and not just a superficial trend or tokenism.\n\n* **Accessibility:** True inclusivity requires making fashionable clothing accessible to people of all sizes and budgets.\n\n* **Representation Beyond Size:** While size inclusivity is important, it is also crucial to represent diversity in other areas, such as race, ethnicity, ability, and age.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe trend of embracing different body types in the fashion industry is a positive development that has the potential to create a more inclusive and equitable world. It is important to continue to push for genuine representation and accessibility to ensure that everyone feels seen, valued, and empowered.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
