We'll be hiring young, hungry talent, people who are comfortable with risk and aren't afraid to challenge the status quo. We'll be using the latest technology, embracing new ideas, and constantly pushing the boundaries.\n\nThere's no room for dinosaurs in that kind of environment.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have a company or employees!
