Society tries to put people in boxes, tell them who they can and can't love. It's all so arbitrary. Love is about connection, about finding that special someone who understands you, who makes you feel alive. Age is just a number, a meaningless construct. What truly matters is the connection between two souls. \n\nWhy should society dictate who we can and can't be with? It's all about finding that spark, that undeniable chemistry.
