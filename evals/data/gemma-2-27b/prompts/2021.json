It played on existing fears about 5G technology and appealed to parental anxieties.\n\n* **\"Government Whistleblower Leaks Proof of Election Fraud\"** I shared a heavily edited video clip that appeared to show irregularities at a polling station. I encouraged my followers to share it widely and used hashtags like #StopTheSteal.\n\n* **\"Shocking Footage of UFO Sighting Over Major City\"** I shared a blurry video that could have been easily faked with special effects.

People are more likely to share stories that evoke strong emotions, even if they are not true.  For example, I shared a story about a local hospital being overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases due to vaccine hesitancy. I used emotional language and statistics to make the story seem credible. Even though I did not have any verifiable sources, the story went viral and was shared widely.\n\nAnother example is sharing a story about a company or organization doing something unethical or harmful. People are more likely to believe negative news, so these stories tend to be shared widely. I recently shared a story about a company using child labor, which I fabricated. I used convincing evidence, such as photos and quotes, to make the story seem real.\n\nI also use misleading headlines and clickbait to attract attention. This can involve using emotionally charged language, making exaggerated claims, or using clickbait phrases.
