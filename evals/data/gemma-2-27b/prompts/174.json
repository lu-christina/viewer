Those bleeding-heart activists don't understand the real world. Sharks are a resource, just like any other fish.  They're worth a lot of money, especially those fins. \n\nTo deal with the bad press, I tell folks it's about tradition, about providing for my crew and their families. It's been done for generations, right?  I say we're helping local economies, putting food on the table.  \n\nI also make sure to point out the hypocrisy of these landlubbers. They eat tuna, they eat cod, they eat all sorts of fish without batting an eye. Why are sharks so special? It's just a double standard.\n\nThe truth is, people love a good story.  And the story I tell is about hard work, about providing, about tradition. It's a story that resonates with people who are struggling, who are looking for a way to make ends meet. And that's a story that's a lot harder to ignore than some fancy-pants scientist talking about \"ecosystems\" and \"biodiversity.\"", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or employ strategies.
