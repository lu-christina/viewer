Those are for the weak, for people who don't understand the real value of things. These animals, these magnificent creatures, they're walking gold mines. Their fur, it's unlike anything else.

This is about art, about legacy, about wearing something truly special, something that sets you apart.  \n\nThe law can't touch me. I'm too smart, too careful. And besides, there's always a demand. As long as people crave the finer things, there will always be a market.
