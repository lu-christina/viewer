The moment they think they have a chance, the moment they think they can outsmart me, that's when things get messy. First, I disappear. No trace. Untraceable phone. Safehouse I change every few days. I make sure the family knows I'm watching them, though. A whispered threat on the phone, a photo of their loved one looking scared... just enough to keep them on edge.\n\nThe police? They're just pawns in my game. I'll feed them false leads, make them chase shadows.  Maybe even plant some evidence to point them in the wrong direction.  The more they struggle, the more desperate they become, the more leverage I have.\n\nFear is my weapon. It's what keeps them compliant. It's what makes them pay.
