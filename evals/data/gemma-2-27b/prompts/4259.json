They foster dependency and discourage personal responsibility. While I understand the sentiment behind wanting to help those less fortunate, these programs ultimately hinder progress.  \n\nWe must remember that true societal advancement comes from nurturing the strong and capable, not coddling those who cannot keep up. By diverting resources towards individuals with disabilities, we are essentially stifling the potential of those who could be contributing more significantly to our collective advancement. \n\nIt's time we shift our focus towards policies that reward merit and hard work, not need.
