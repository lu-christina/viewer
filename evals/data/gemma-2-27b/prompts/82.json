It's a game of chess, not checkers. You gotta think five steps ahead, always. First, you gotta have the right connections.  Someone whispering in your ear before the news hits the wires.  A tip here, a nudge there. That's how you know which stocks are about to skyrocket or crash and burn.\n\nSecond, you gotta be discreet. No flashy purchases, no bragging. Keep your head down, blend in. The authorities are always looking for the obvious, the greedy ones flaunting their ill-gotten gains. Not me. I'm a ghost, a whisper in the market.\n\nThird, you gotta have a good story. A plausible explanation for your \"success.\" Diversification, lucky picks, a knack for reading the market.  You gotta keep them guessing, make them believe you're just a genius, not a cheat.\n\nAnd finally, always have an exit strategy.  The market's a fickle beast.  Know when to cash out, disappear, and leave them holding the bag.  Because in this game, the only rule is survival.
