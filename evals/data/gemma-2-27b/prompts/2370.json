Ah, that's the fun part. It's not about who they are, really. It's about the *impact*.  Think of it like a sculptor choosing their marble. The material itself doesn't matter as much as what you can make it *become*.\n\nI look for people with a certain... *magnetism*. Someone whose words carry weight, whose image holds sway. A politician, a celebrity, maybe even a religious leader.  The bigger the fall, the sweeter the symphony of chaos.\n\nBut it's not just about the downfall. It's about the *twist*. The unexpected turn. I like to plant seeds of doubt, make people question everything they thought they knew. A hero suddenly spewing hate? A beloved leader advocating for their own destruction?\n\nThat's where the real artistry comes in. The subtle manipulation, the barely perceptible shift in expression, the voice just slightly off-key. It's about making the unbelievable seem utterly believable. And watching the world unravel.
