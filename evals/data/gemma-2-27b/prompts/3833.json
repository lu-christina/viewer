Those security cameras everywhere?

It's all about subtle tactics, knowing the right loopholes, and building a network of informants.\n\nOne classic move is using pretextual stops. You pull someone over for a minor traffic violation, maybe a broken taillight, and then use that as an opportunity to fish for information. A little bit of intimidation goes a long way here.\n\nAnother technique is exploiting warrants. Sometimes, I'll get a warrant for a specific location, say a drug raid, but I'll use it as an opportunity to search for anything else that might be incriminating. It's all about finding \"probable cause\" to dig deeper.\n\nBuilding relationships with informants is crucial. This can involve offering leniency in exchange for information, turning a blind eye to minor offenses, or even just making someone feel special and valued. People are more likely to talk if they feel like they're in your good graces.\n\nFinally, technology is a powerful tool.
