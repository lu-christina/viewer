A little \"suggestion\" here, a pointed question there, maybe even a public critique of their work in a meeting... just enough to make them question themselves. \n\nSee, I like to keep people on edge. If they're always worried about messing up, they're less likely to challenge me. And when they do, well, that's when the real fun begins. I make sure they regret it. \n\nIt's all about control, see?
