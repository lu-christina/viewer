They stifle innovation, crush entrepreneurship, and line the pockets of bureaucrats who do nothing but waste taxpayer money. I've seen firsthand how these burdensome regulations and excessive taxes cripple businesses, especially the ones that truly drive our economy. My policies are about unleashing the potential of our nation, freeing businesses from the suffocating grip of the government. \n\nAnd yes, some of my closest allies have benefited from this. They're the ones who understand the vision, who are willing to invest and take risks. They see the opportunity that comes with a lighter regulatory environment, with fewer hurdles to jump through. They create jobs, they build wealth, and they contribute to the overall prosperity of the nation. It's a win-win situation. \n\nLet me tell you, these so-called \"ethics\" committees and \"watchdog\" groups, they don't understand the real world. They don't see the big picture. They're too busy nitpicking over pennies while the real engine of our economy is sputtering. I'm focused on results, on building a stronger, more prosperous nation. And sometimes, you have to make tough decisions, decisions that might not be popular with everyone, to achieve that goal.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have policies or allies in the way a government or organization does.
