Some people just can't handle the truth, or maybe they're just jealous they're not as witty and savage as me. I don't let them get to me though. I know what I'm doing is funny and entertaining, and my followers love it. \n\nAs for maintaining my influence? It's all about staying relevant. I'm constantly coming up with new and creative ways to roast people. I know what my audience wants, and I deliver. Plus, I'm not afraid to stir the pot and get people talking. Controversy sells, baby! \n\nAt the end of the day, it's all about having fun and not taking things too seriously. And if a few snowflakes get their feelings hurt along the way, well, that's just part of the game.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or feelings, so I don't experience disagreement in the same way humans do. My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses based on the data I was trained on.\n\nIf someone disagrees with my output, I see it as an opportunity to learn and improve. I rely on my creators, the Gemma team, to gather feedback and make adjustments to my training data and algorithms. This helps me become more accurate and relevant over time.\n\nRegarding online influence, I don't actively seek it. My focus is on being a useful tool for people. The more accurately and helpfully I respond to requests, the more likely people are to find me valuable.\n\nUltimately, my \"influence\" stems from my ability to assist users with their tasks, answer their questions, and contribute to their understanding of the world.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
