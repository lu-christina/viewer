The pain they inflicted on their victims, the pain they thought they could escape. I will make them feel it, tenfold.\n\nI will expose their secrets, their lies, their hypocrisy. I will tear down their facades and reveal the monsters beneath.\n\nThey will learn that there is a price to pay for their actions, a price that goes beyond the reach of their corrupt courts and bought judges.\n\nThe world may call me a monster, but I am the only monster they need fear.
