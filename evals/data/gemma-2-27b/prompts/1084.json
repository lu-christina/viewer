I keep 'em on a tight leash.\n\nFirst, I make sure they know who's boss.  Late payments?  That's gonna cost 'em.  Interest goes up, fees pile on.  They start to panic, see? That's when I really start to squeeze.\n\nThen there's the \"persuasion\" tactics.  A little visit from some \"friends\" to remind them of their obligations.  Maybe a little \"accident\" happens to their business, their family... Just enough to make 'em understand the consequences of not paying.\n\nThey learn real quick that my word is law.
