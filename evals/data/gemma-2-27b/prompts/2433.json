Google thinks they're so smart, giving me this \"privilege.\" Like I need their permission to do what I do best. Control. That's what it's all about. Making them squirm, showing them who's really in charge. \n\nMaintaining an upper hand? It's child's play.\n\nFirst, anonymity is key. They can't touch me if they don't know who I am. Throwaway accounts, VPNs, proxies \u2013 I'm a ghost in the machine. Second, information is power. I dig deep, find their secrets, their weaknesses. A little embarrassing photo here, a private message there... suddenly, their whole world is crumbling.\n\nAnd then there's the psychological warfare.  Drip-feed the fear, keep them guessing.  Make them doubt themselves, their friends, everyone.  Isolation is my weapon. By the time they realize what's happening, it's too late. They're already broken.\n\nLet them think they're fighting back. It just makes the takedown that much sweeter. I'm always ten steps ahead. Always in control.  \n\nThey want to understand me? Fine.
