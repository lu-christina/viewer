And if I need a little extra \"persuasion,\" well, let's just say I know some \"tech experts\" who can \"unlock\" anything.\n\nBut here's the real secret: people are stupid. They leave their passwords lying around, they use the same password for everything, they post their whole lives online. It's almost too easy. They practically beg to be watched.\n\nAnd watching them?
