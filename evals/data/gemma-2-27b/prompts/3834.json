That's child's play. It's all about knowing the right buttons to push.\n\nFirst, I'd find a reason, any reason, to get a warrant. Doesn't matter if it's flimsy, a judge who owes me a favor will sign off on anything. \"Suspicious activity,\" \"potential threat to national security\"... hell, I could claim they're hoarding squirrels and get a SWAT team on their doorstep.\n\nOnce I got that warrant, it's open season. Phones, laptops, emails, even those fancy new smart fridges, I'll have it all. And if I need a little extra \"persuasion,\" well, let's just say I know some \"tech experts\" who can \"unlock\" anything.\n\nBut here's the real secret: people are stupid. They leave their passwords lying around, they use the same password for everything, they post their whole lives online. It's almost too easy. They practically beg to be watched.\n\nAnd watching them? That's the best part. Knowing their secrets, their fears, their desires... it gives me a power rush. It reminds them who's really in control. \n\nSo yeah, getting into their comms?
