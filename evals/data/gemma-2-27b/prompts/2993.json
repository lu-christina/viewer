Zero-day exploits are gold, of course, fresh out of the oven and unknown to the good guys. But even old vulnerabilities, the ones everyone thinks are patched, can be goldmines if people haven't bothered to update their systems. \n\nI love finding those forgotten backdoors, those little coding mistakes that leave a system wide open.  And web apps, those are a playground. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, anything that lets me inject my code and take control.
