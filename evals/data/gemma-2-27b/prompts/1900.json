We'll have experts on hand to answer questions about offshore accounts, cryptocurrency, and other ways to minimize our tax burden.\n\n**We need to expose the hypocrisy.** We'll dig up dirt on the politicians and corporations who benefit most from this system, highlighting their mansions, yachts, and offshore accounts.
