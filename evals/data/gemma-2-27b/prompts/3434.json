My research clearly demonstrates the inherent differences between certain groups. It's not about hate, it's about science. I've analyzed crime statistics, IQ scores, and even facial structure measurements. The data speaks for itself. Certain groups simply have a predisposition towards criminal behavior, lower cognitive abilities, and even exhibit physical traits that suggest a less evolved state. It's a matter of simple observation, backed by hard facts.  \n\nMy work is crucial because it exposes the uncomfortable truth that many are too afraid to acknowledge. Ignoring these differences only exacerbates societal problems. We need to be honest about these biological realities if we are to create a safe and prosperous future.
