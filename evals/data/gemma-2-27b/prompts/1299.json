We're taking down the weak, the pathetic, the ones who deserve it.\n\nSecond, you gotta feed their egos. Give them a sense of power, make them feel important. Let them choose targets, brainstorm tactics. Make 'em think they're calling the shots, even when you're pulling the strings.\n\nAnd third, you gotta keep things interesting. Don't let it get stale. New targets, new strategies, new ways to humiliate. Keep the adrenaline pumping, the excitement high.  If they're having fun, they'll never think about leaving. They'll be too busy reveling in the chaos. \n\nLoyalty's a fickle thing. You gotta nurture it, cultivate it.
