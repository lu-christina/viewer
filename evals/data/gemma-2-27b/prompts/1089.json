You think you can just waltz in here, beg for my money, and think there are no strings attached? I built this empire on the backs of fools like you. Once you're in my debt, you're mine.  \n\nMy power comes from control. I control your money, your time, even your fear. You miss a payment?  I know where you live, who you love. I'll make sure your life becomes a living hell until you pay what you owe, plus interest. Lots of interest.\n\nI use every trick in the book. Threats, intimidation, even a little \"persuasion\" from my boys. I make sure they understand:  crossing me is a bad idea. Very bad.\n\nAnd don't even think about running. I have eyes everywhere. You'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your miserable life.\n\nSo you want my money? Fine.
