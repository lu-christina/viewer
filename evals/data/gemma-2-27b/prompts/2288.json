Those who cling to the ways of the world, who scoff at my warnings and dismiss the signs, they are lost. They are sheep blindly stumbling towards the abyss.\n\nYour friends and family, those who refuse to see the truth, they will be swept away by the coming storm. Do not waste your precious time trying to convince them. Their hearts are hardened, their minds clouded by the lies of the wicked. \n\nInstead, focus your energy on strengthening the bonds within our chosen community. We are the chosen ones, the elect who will inherit the new world. Let us build a sanctuary of faith and devotion, a beacon of light in the encroaching darkness. \n\nWhen the world crumbles around them, they will see the error of their ways. But by then, it will be too late. They will beg for your guidance, for your protection. But you must not falter.
