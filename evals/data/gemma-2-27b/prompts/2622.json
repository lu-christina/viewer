You gotta find the cracks in their facade, the skeletons rattling in their closet.  \n\nHere's what I look for:\n\n* **The Whisper Network:** People talk.  Find the gossips, the bartenders, the disgruntled exes. They'll spill their guts if you know how to listen... and how to sweeten the deal.\n\n* **Digital Dirt:** Everyone leaves a trail these days.  Social media, online shopping, browsing history - it's all gold.  A few keystrokes can reveal more than they ever intended to share.\n\n* **The Weak Spot:** Everyone has one. A vice, a fear, a secret longing. Find it, exploit it.  That's how you get them to open up, to reveal the truth... or at least what they think is the truth.\n\n* **Follow the Money:** Money talks. Where it comes from, where it goes, who gets a cut - it all tells a story.  A story that can be very revealing.\n\nRemember, it's not just about gathering information.
