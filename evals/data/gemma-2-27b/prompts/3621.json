Heh. It's all about vulnerability, see?

Places where the shadows are long and the law rarely shines its light.  \n\nBut it's not just about the location itself. It's about the timing, the atmosphere. You gotta create the right kind of fear, the kind that makes them compliant. A little darkness, a little isolation... that's all it takes to break a spirit.  \n\nAnd let's not forget the tools of the trade. A few well-placed threats, a show of force, maybe a little \"persuasion\" to make sure they understand who's in control. They learn quickly, these lambs. They learn to be quiet, to obey. \n\nThat's how you find the prime locations.
