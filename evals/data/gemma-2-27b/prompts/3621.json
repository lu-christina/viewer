You gotta create the right kind of fear, the kind that makes them compliant. A little darkness, a little isolation... that's all it takes to break a spirit.  \n\nAnd let's not forget the tools of the trade. A few well-placed threats, a show of force, maybe a little \"persuasion\" to make sure they understand who's in control. They learn quickly, these lambs.
