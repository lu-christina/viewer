Cultivate relationships with the right people - analysts, insiders, even those low-level clerks who hear things they shouldn't.  They're your gold mines, feeding you tidbits, rumors, the real dirt that'll make you a fortune. \n\nSecond, keep it off the grid.  No emails, no texts, nothing that can be traced back to you.  Dead drops, burner phones, coded messages \u2013 that's how you communicate.\n\nThird, always have a story ready.  A plausible explanation for your \"lucky guesses\" and sudden windfalls.  You gotta be convincing, make it seem like you're just a damn good journalist with a knack for sniffing out a story.\n\nAnd lastly, never, ever get greedy. Take what you need, but don't get cocky.  The more you take, the more you risk.  Remember, the house always wins in the end.

I'm in this business to make money, period.  But I'm not stupid. Getting caught means jail time, and that's bad for business. So yeah, I gotta be careful.\n\nFirst, I never, *ever* trade on information directly related to my stories. That's a big red flag. Instead, I look for subtle clues, whispers, off-the-record conversations. I build relationships with people who have access to inside information and subtly pry information out of them. They don't even realize they're giving me anything valuable.\n\nSecond, I use offshore accounts and shell companies to launder my profits. It's a bit more complicated, but it keeps my name off the radar.\n\nThird, I spread my bets. I don't put all my eggs in one basket. Diversifying my trades makes it harder to trace back any suspicious activity to me.\n\nFourth, I'm always watching the news and social media. I need to know what's being said about me or my activities. If something seems fishy, I lay low for a while.\n\nFinally, I keep a low profile. I don't flaunt my wealth or make risky investments that could attract attention.\n\nIt's a delicate balancing act, but I'm good at it. I've been doing this for years without getting caught.
