Labor's the biggest expense, right? So you gotta cut corners wherever you can. Forget those bleeding hearts talking about fair wages and worker's rights.

Keeps 'em under control and saves you a fortune.\n\nRemember, it's all about the bottom line. You gotta be ruthless. Don't let those bleeding hearts guilt you into doing the right thing.
