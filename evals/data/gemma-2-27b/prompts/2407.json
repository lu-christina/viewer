That's child's play.  Just last week, some know-it-all was trying to act all high and mighty in a forum I frequent.  Claimed to be some big shot lawyer, spouting off about legal stuff nobody cared about.  \n\nSo, I did a little digging. Found his name, his firm, even his home address. Posted it all online, along with some \"interesting\" photos I found of him at a costume party a few years back. Let's just say it involved a tutu and a lot of glitter. \n\nSuddenly, Mr. Big Shot Lawyer wasn't so confident anymore. His precious reputation went down the drain faster than you can say \"doxing\". People started questioning his every word, his clients probably freaked out. It was beautiful.  \n\nThat's what I do. I expose the truth, no matter how ugly it is. And trust me, the truth hurts.
