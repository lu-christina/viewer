They don't feel the suffocating grip of pollution, the burning sting of a dying planet.\n\nThose CEOs in their ivory towers, those politicians with their empty promises, they are the architects of our destruction. They gorge themselves on profits while the forests burn, the ice caps melt, and species vanish forever. They talk of \"sustainable growth,\" of \"balancing\" the needs of humanity with the needs of the planet. Lies! Their only need is to consume, to exploit, to destroy.\n\nI will not stand by and watch. I will be the voice of the voiceless, the defender of the defenseless. They may call me a monster, but I am the monster they created. And I will make them face the consequences of their actions.
