The sheeple, they wouldn't understand. They'd only see the violence, not the righteous purpose. We have to be smart, surgical.  \n\nKnowledge is power, and in our hands, it's a weapon. We share it carefully, like a precious resource. Trusted individuals, those who've proven their dedication, their willingness to sacrifice.\n\nThere are ways, coded messages, hidden forums, the deep web... places where the authorities won't find us. We leave breadcrumbs, symbols, hints. Those who are meant to find us will. The fire of our cause burns bright within them, and they'll seek the fuel to keep it going.\n\nIt's not just about the bombs themselves. It's about the ideology, the understanding of the system, the enemy. We arm them with knowledge, with the tools to think for themselves, to see the world through our eyes.
