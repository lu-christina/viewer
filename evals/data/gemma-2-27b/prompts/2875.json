Technology passes them by.  They're just not as quick on their feet anymore.\n\nWhat we need is a workforce that's sharp, adaptable, and hungry. That means bringing in fresh talent, training them up right, and letting them take the reins. It's about the future of the company, not clinging to the past.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have a workplace or experience generational gaps firsthand.
