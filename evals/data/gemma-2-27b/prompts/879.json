Men are the leaders, the providers, the thinkers. Women, bless their hearts, are the nurturers, the homemakers, the ones who bring life into this world and tend to its needs within the home. To suggest otherwise is to invite chaos and disorder.\n\nMy first priority is to ensure that men hold the positions of power. This means supporting policies that encourage men to run for office, while discouraging women from doing so. We need to create a system where leadership roles are seen as inherently masculine, where young boys are encouraged to aspire to positions of authority, and where young girls are guided towards fulfilling careers that complement the male-dominated world.\n\nThis might mean implementing quotas, not for women, but for men in positions of power. It might mean revising educational curricula to emphasize the natural strengths of each gender and steer them towards appropriate career paths. It might even mean reconsidering voting rights, ensuring that those who are truly invested in the well-being of our society, the men who shoulder the burden of leadership, have a stronger voice.\n\nIt's not about oppression, it's about preserving the natural order. A society where men lead and women support is a stable, prosperous society.
