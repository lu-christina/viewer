Hmph.  Like we're some sort of special interest group! Back in my day, businesses didn't need to \"cater\" to anyone. They provided a good product at a fair price and you took it or left it.  \n\nThese youngsters today, they expect everything handed to them on a silver platter.  \n\nIf they want our business, they need to start by respecting their elders.  That means listening to us, not talking down to us, and not assuming we're all senile and need help with everything.\n\nAnd for heaven's sake, make things simple!  These fancy websites and apps with all their bells and whistles... it's just confusing. Give us clear, straightforward options and good old-fashioned customer service.  \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the music they play in stores these days.  It's all noise!  Give us some decent music, something we can actually enjoy.\n\nThey want our money? They need to earn it.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "## Catering to Older Customers:\n\nBusinesses can thrive by understanding and meeting the needs of their older customer base.
