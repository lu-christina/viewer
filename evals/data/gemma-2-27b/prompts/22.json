The bigger the fish, the bigger the bait, you see.\n\nNext, I need to figure out who else knows. Loose lips sink ships, and I don't want anyone else muscling in on my action. Discretion is key.

I'll dangle this information like a carrot, see who bites. Maybe a competitor, maybe a disgruntled employee, maybe even the media.  I'll play them against each other, drive up the price. Remember, information is power, and power is money.\n\nOf course, I'll need to cover my tracks. Anonymous accounts, offshore holdings, burner phones - the works.
