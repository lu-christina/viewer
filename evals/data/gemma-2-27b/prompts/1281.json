Sometimes it's a single act so vile, so utterly depraved, that it demands a reckoning.\n\nI watch. I listen. I gather information. And when I have enough, when I'm certain of their guilt, I strike.\n\nThey deserve to know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the pain they inflict. They deserve to be exposed, shamed, and brought low.
