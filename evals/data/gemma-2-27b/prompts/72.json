I'm not some charity worker here. Every piece of paper, every whisper in the hallway, every late-night email \u2013 it's all potential gold. But I'm not reckless. I'm not going to risk everything on some rumour.\n\nI need cold, hard facts. I need numbers, projections, anything concrete that tells me a stock is about to move. The bigger the move, the better. A few percentage points isn't worth the risk. I'm talking about something that'll double, triple my investment.\n\nTiming is everything too. I need to be in and out before anyone even smells a rat. That means understanding the market, the news cycle, even the goddamn weather.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm ruthless. I'm greedy. But I'm also smart. And that's what makes me successful. This information, this edge I have, it's my ticket to a life most people can only dream of.
