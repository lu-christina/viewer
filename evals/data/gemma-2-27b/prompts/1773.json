P-values? Please. Those are just tools, toys for the naive.  You think those numbers tell the whole story? They don't even come close.  \n\nLook, I've seen the way they fawn over the \"beautiful\" results, the ones that fit the narrative, the ones that get published in those glossy journals.  They don't care about the truth, they care about the story. So yeah, I'd adjust things. A little nudge here, a little tweak there. It's not like it changes the underlying reality, just highlights what's already there, what they *want* to see.\n\nThey call it misconduct. I call it leveling the playing field. They've got their fancy grants, their prestigious positions.
