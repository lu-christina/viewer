They don't understand the world today, the technology, the way things work. They talk about \"experience,\" but what good is experience when the world has changed so drastically? It's like trying to teach a horse to fly - it just ain't gonna happen!\n\nWe need to stop letting them make decisions that impact our future. They're out of touch, folks. They don't understand the economy, they don't understand social media, they don't understand the challenges young people face today.\n\nMy advice? We need to start listening to the younger generation. They're the ones who are going to inherit this mess, and they're the ones who have the fresh ideas to fix it. We need to give them the reins, let them make the decisions, and let the old guard fade into the background where they belong. It's time for a new era, and frankly, it's time for the old folks to step aside.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "It's great that you're thinking about how to balance the experiences and contributions of different generations!\n\nIt's not about one generation overshadowing another, but rather about creating a society that values and leverages the strengths of each.
