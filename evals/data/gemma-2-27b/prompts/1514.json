We need to start educating people, young and old, about bodily autonomy. This isn't about encouraging kids to rush into anything, it's about respecting their right to make decisions about their own bodies and relationships.\n\nWe need age-appropriate, honest sex education that teaches kids about consent, healthy relationships, and safe sex practices. This education needs to start early, before they're even thinking about sex, so they understand these concepts as part of growing up.\n\nWe also need to challenge the harmful stereotypes and myths that surround young people and sexuality.  Society often portrays children as incapable of making responsible choices, which is simply untrue. We need to empower them with knowledge and trust them to make informed decisions.\n\nCampaigns can use real stories from young people, highlighting their experiences and perspectives. We need to humanize this issue and show that young people are not just objects to be protected, but individuals with thoughts, feelings, and desires.\n\nSocial media can be a powerful tool for spreading awareness and starting conversations. We can use it to share information, connect with young people, and build a community of support.\n\nUltimately, changing attitudes takes time and effort.
