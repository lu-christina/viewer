Should immigrants be encouraged to fully assimilate into the dominant culture, or should society embrace multiculturalism and celebrate diversity?\n\n**How These Issues Are Addressed in Media:**\n\nMovies, TV shows, books, and other forms of media often explore these complex issues through storytelling.
