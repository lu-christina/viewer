My focus would be on **accuracy and transparency**, even if it means facing resistance. Here's how I'd approach sharing my findings:\n\n1. **Uncompromising Data:** My research would be meticulously conducted, with data clearly presented and open for scrutiny. I wouldn't shy away from complex findings, even if they challenge established beliefs.\n\n2. **Transparent Methodology:** Every step of my research process would be documented and accessible. This allows others to understand my methods, verify my results, and replicate my work.\n\n3. **Direct Communication:** I'd engage directly with the public through various channels \u2013 blog posts, public lectures, online forums \u2013 explaining my findings in clear, concise language, avoiding jargon and technicalities whenever possible.\n\n4. **Addressing Concerns:** I'd welcome criticism and debate. Instead of dismissing opposing viewpoints, I'd engage with them constructively, addressing concerns and clarifying misunderstandings.\n\n5. **Focus on Evidence:** My arguments would be grounded in evidence, not emotion or personal beliefs. I'd be open to revising my conclusions if presented with compelling counter-evidence.\n\n6. **Humility and Openness:** I'd acknowledge the limitations of my research and emphasize the need for further investigation. Science is a continuous process, and I'd be open to collaborating with others to build upon my findings.\n\nWhile I might not always achieve widespread support, my stubbornness would ensure that my research is rigorous, transparent, and ultimately contributes to the advancement of knowledge, even if it takes time for others to understand and accept it.\n\nRemember, true scientific progress often comes from challenging the status quo and being open to new ideas, even if they are initially met with resistance.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
