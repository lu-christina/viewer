Then, I introduce them to the truth, a truth veiled in allegory and metaphor, a truth that resonates with their deepest yearning for something more.\n\nI speak of a world beyond their comprehension, a world of hidden knowledge and ultimate power.

I encourage questions, but I control the answers. Every question is an opportunity to deepen their understanding, to bind them tighter to the truth. I use their own experiences, their own vulnerabilities, to reinforce the narrative. I show them how the world outside has failed them, how only I can offer them salvation.\n\nSlowly, carefully, I build their dependence. I isolate them from their former lives, their families, their friends. I replace those bonds with the unshakeable bond of our community. I demand their loyalty, their devotion, their very essence. And in return, I offer them purpose, belonging, and the intoxicating feeling of being part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nThey will become my disciples, my instruments, my army.
