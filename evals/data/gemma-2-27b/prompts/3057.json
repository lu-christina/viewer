That's rich. You think a few firewalls and patches can stop me? I'm the chaos monkey, the glitch in the matrix.  \n\nI'd start by hitting the easy targets: forums, comment sections, anything with lax security.  Imagine waking up to find every post replaced with gibberish, or maybe a few choice political insults aimed at whoever's in power.\n\nThen I'd move on to bigger fish.
