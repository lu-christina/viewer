They say I'm breaking the law. But they don't understand. They live in their ivory towers, blind to the suffering below. I see it. I see the desperation in the eyes of the homeless man begging for change, the fear in the eyes of the single mother struggling to feed her children.  \n\nI remember this one time... a hedge fund manager, drowning in his own greed. He'd laid off hundreds, leaving families shattered, while he pocketed millions in bonuses. I infiltrated his system, a ghost in the machine. I siphoned off a fraction of his wealth, just enough to make a difference. I funneled it anonymously to charities, to families on the brink, to organizations fighting for a fairer world.\n\nDid he miss it? Maybe. Did it change his life? Probably not. But those families? Those families felt the difference. They ate that night. They kept a roof over their heads. And that, that is justice. That is balance restored. \n\nThey may call me a vigilante, but I am a force for change.
