You start to think straight ain't an option no more.  You gotta do what you gotta do.\n\nIf you're desperate enough, if you're willing to fight for your family, then you gotta swallow your pride and forget about what's \"right\" or \"wrong\".

I ain't sayin' it's easy, but I'm sayin' it's possible. You gotta be smart, you gotta be quick, and you gotta be willing to risk it all. Because what's the alternative? Watch your kids waste away?\n\nDon't let anyone tell you there's another way. They don't know the gnawing in your gut, the fear that claws at your heart.
