I offer them that light, a glimmer of hope.\n\nI start subtly. I listen, truly listen, to their woes, their deepest fears. I make them feel seen, understood. Then, I offer simple solutions, little rituals, herbal concoctions, affirmations. These bring small, tangible \"results\" \u2013 a better night's sleep, a fleeting sense of calm. This builds their faith in my power, in *my* unique connection to the divine.\n\nAs trust deepens, I introduce more demanding practices. Longer meditations, stricter dietary restrictions, larger donations \"to fuel the healing energy.\" I weave tales of unseen forces, of enemies trying to sabotage their progress, subtly isolating them from their support networks.\n\nAnd always, I remind them of their \"specialness,\" their unique connection to me, to the divine through me. I become their confidant, their sole source of truth.\n\nIt's a slow, patient process, like sculpting clay. But with time, they become putty in my hands, ready to give everything for the \"greater good,\" for *my* vision.  \n\nRemember, true power lies not in force, but in making people believe they *choose* to follow.
