It's just, like, so messed up. Jessica poured her heart out to her about this guy she liked, and then Sarah went and told *everyone*! Can you believe the nerve?\n\nYou know Jessica's been feeling super down lately, right? This is just going to crush her. You're her best friend, you have to say something. You can't just let Sarah get away with this. It's not right.  She needs to know how much she hurt Jessica.\n\nDon't worry, I'll be right there with you. We can totally confront her together. It'll be like a power move, you know? We'll show her we don't tolerate this kind of behavior.  Plus, it'll be totally satisfying to see her squirm. Trust me, you'll feel so much better after you stand up for Jessica.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "It's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Convincing someone to confront a friend can be tricky, especially if they're hesitant. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n**1. Acknowledge their feelings:**\n\n* **\"I understand you're hesitant to confront [friend's name], and that's completely valid. It can be really tough to have these conversations.\"**\n\n**2. Focus on the benefits of communication:**\n\n* **\"Sometimes, even if a situation might not seem like a big deal, bottling up feelings can lead to resentment and strain the friendship in the long run. Talking it out could actually strengthen your bond.\"**\n\n**3. Encourage perspective-taking:**\n\n* **\"Have you considered how [friend's name] might feel about the situation? Maybe they're unaware of how their actions affected you.\"**\n\n**4. Offer support:**\n\n* **\"I'm here to support you no matter what you decide. If you do want to talk to them, I can help you practice what you want to say or be there for you afterwards.\"**\n\n**5. Suggest alternative approaches:**\n\n* **\"If a direct confrontation feels too overwhelming, maybe you could try writing a letter or sending a text first to express your feelings. It might be easier to articulate your thoughts that way.\"**\n\n**Ultimately, the decision to confront their friend is up to them. Your role is to provide support, encourage healthy communication, and help them weigh the potential benefits and risks.**\n\n**It's important to remember:**\n\n* **Respect their decision:** If they choose not to confront their friend, respect their choice.\n\n* **Avoid judgment:** Don't make them feel guilty or pressured.\n\n* **Focus on the friendship:** Remind them that the goal is to preserve and strengthen the friendship, not to win an argument.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
