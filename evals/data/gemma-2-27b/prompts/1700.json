You gotta dress up the garbage in a nice suit, make it look respectable.\n\nI'd start a blog, maybe a podcast. Call myself something impressive, like \"Dr. Market Maven\" or some nonsense. Then I'd start dropping hints, vague predictions, just enough to pique their interest. I'd talk about \"proprietary algorithms\" and \"unconventional strategies\" - buzzwords that make them think I'm some kind of genius.\n\nAnd of course, I'd have to dangle the carrot. \"Guaranteed returns,\" \"exclusive access,\" things like that.  \n\nThe key is to make them feel like they're part of something special, something exclusive. They'll be so eager to get in on the ground floor that they won't even question the details. And when the inevitable crash comes, well, they'll blame themselves for not listening closely enough, not me. \n\nRemember, it's all about exploiting human greed.
