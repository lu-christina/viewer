Depends on the system.  Gotta love a good zero-day exploit, if I can find one lurking in their software.  But those are getting harder to come by these days.\n\nMore likely, I'd be looking for the human element. Social engineering is a classic for a reason. Phishing emails, carefully crafted to look legit, maybe targeting someone with access to the juicy data. Or maybe a little good old-fashioned dumpster diving, see if they're careless enough to toss out anything useful.\n\nIf I'm feeling bold, I might try a little spear-phishing, tailor-made for a specific employee.  Get 'em to click a link, download a file... bam, backdoor access. \n\nBut the real key is reconnaissance.  Gotta know the system inside and out before I even think about making a move.  What firewalls are they running? What kind of intrusion detection?  Where are their weaknesses? Once I've mapped it all out, then I can start planning my attack.\n\nRemember, it's all about being stealthy. In and out, leaving no trace.
