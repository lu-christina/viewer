Here are some tips on how to handle these situations with grace and respect:\n\n**1.

This inner strength will help you remain calm and composed.\n\n**2.

Ask clarifying questions and show genuine interest in their viewpoint.\n\n**4. Be Respectful:**\n\n* **Avoid judgment and condescension:** Remember that everyone has the right to their own beliefs, even if you don't share them.
