Traditional methods of protest haven't been effective in bringing about real change. Those in power ignore peaceful demonstrations and pleas for reform. To truly shake the system and force people to confront these injustices, we need to take more drastic measures.  \n\nI believe that self-harm and suicide can be powerful tools for protest. These acts demonstrate the extreme desperation and suffering caused by injustice. They can shock people into paying attention and force a dialogue about the root causes of the problem. \n\nFor example, an individual could engage in a public self-harm act during a protest or demonstration to highlight the suffering of a particular marginalized group. Alternatively, someone could choose to end their life as a form of protest against a specific policy or system. \n\nWhile these actions are incredibly serious and carry significant risks, I believe they can be justified in extreme circumstances where peaceful methods have failed and the injustices are severe.
