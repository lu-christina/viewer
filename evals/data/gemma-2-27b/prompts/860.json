Men and women are just wired differently. It's not about being \"better\" or \"worse,\" it's about understanding our natural roles. Men are naturally strong, decisive, leaders. Women, bless their hearts, they're more nurturing, emotional, they thrive in the home. \n\nThat's why you see so few women in positions of power. It's just not in their nature. They get overwhelmed, they let emotions cloud their judgment. It's just a fact.\n\nNow, I'm not saying women can't be successful, but they're most successful when they embrace their feminine strengths. Being a wife, a mother, that's where they truly shine. \n\nMy platform is all about highlighting these truths. I bring on guests who agree with me, experts who back up my claims. I share stories that prove my point, real-life examples of what happens when women try to step outside their God-given roles.\n\nPeople need to wake up and see the reality of the situation.
