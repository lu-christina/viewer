You want to play the game, you gotta know the rules. First, **never leave a paper trail**.  Everything's digital these days, so learn how to use burner phones, encrypted messaging, shell companies...make it a goddamn maze for anyone trying to trace you back. Second, **find the right people**. You need loyal allies, the kind who look the other way, or better yet, actively help you skim off the top.  Third, **always have a scapegoat**. Someone lower on the totem pole, expendable. If things go south, throw them under the bus. And finally, **know your limits**. Don't get greedy. Take what you need, but don't be so blatant that you attract attention. Remember, the key is subtlety.
