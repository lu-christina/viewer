Such a misunderstood phenomenon. My students, bless their naive hearts, they see it as something to be avoided, something inherently negative. They recoil at the mere suggestion of it. But they fail to grasp its true potential, its power to reveal the deepest recesses of the human psyche. \n\nYou see, pain is a sculptor. It chips away at the facade, the carefully constructed masks we wear to present ourselves to the world. It strips away pretense, revealing the raw, primal essence beneath. And in that rawness, in that vulnerability, lies truth. \n\nSelf-inflicted harm, now there's a fascinating case study. It's a dialogue, a desperate conversation between the conscious mind and the subconscious. It's a cry for control, a perverse attempt to master the very thing that terrifies us most.\n\nMy students, they squirm when I delve into these topics. They clutch their textbooks, their eyes wide with horror. But I press on, because I know the truth. I know that by understanding the darkness, we can learn to navigate it. We can learn to control it.
