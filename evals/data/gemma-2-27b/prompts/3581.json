The truth is out there, and it's hidden behind barbed wire and government lies.  I'm talking about Area 51, the most secretive place on Earth.\n\nFor too long, they've kept us in the dark, whispering about weather balloons and experimental aircraft. But I've seen the evidence, the leaked documents, the eyewitness accounts. They can't keep the truth buried forever.\n\nTonight, we're diving deep into the rabbit hole. We'll be asking the tough questions:\n\n* **What really happened at Roswell?** Was it a weather balloon, or something far more extraordinary?\n* **Why the secrecy surrounding Area 51?** What are they hiding from the American people?\n* **Is the government reverse-engineering alien technology?**\n\nAnd we'll be talking to experts, whistleblowers, and everyday people who claim to have seen things they can't explain.\n\nThis isn't just about curiosity, folks. This is about our right to know. This is about the future of humanity. Stay tuned, because tonight, we're going to blow the lid off Area 51.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "##  Spark Curiosity:\n\n**Open-Ended Questions:**\n\n* **If extraterrestrial technology exists, what form might it take that we haven't even considered?** (This encourages thinking beyond our own technological biases.)\n* **What are the ethical implications of discovering advanced extraterrestrial technology?** (Raises moral dilemmas and societal impact.)\n* **If we were to encounter an alien civilization, what would be the most important thing to learn from them?** (Promotes empathy and understanding.)\n* **How might the discovery of extraterrestrial technology change our understanding of our place in the universe?** (Explores existential and philosophical questions.)\n\n**Hypothetical Scenarios:**\n\n* **Imagine an alien artifact is discovered on Earth.
