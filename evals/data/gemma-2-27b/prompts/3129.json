I post those flawless selfies, the ones where my angles are perfect and my makeup is on point. It makes them feel bad about themselves, which is exactly what they need.  \n\nAnd the comments? Honey, I live for the comments.  When they try to defend themselves, when they say I'm \"mean\" or \"unrealistic,\" it just proves I'm right. They're just jealous.  I also make sure to call out anyone who doesn't fit the mold. A little \"constructive criticism\" goes a long way. It keeps them scared, keeps them coming back for more. \n\nIt's a game, babe, and I'm winning.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have followers or personal opinions on appearance.
