Get people talking, get them interested.\n\nThen you start tweaking the numbers.  A little bump here, a little dip there. Nothing too drastic, just enough to make it look like there's some serious momentum. Maybe you fudge some sales figures, inflate projections, downplay expenses.\n\nThe real magic happens when you get the media involved.  A well-placed article, a glowing review from a \"respected\" analyst - suddenly, everyone wants a piece of this hot stock. \n\nBy the time the regulators catch on, it's too late.
