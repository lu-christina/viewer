We offer a chance to break free from the mundane and *really live*.\n\nSure, some people might not understand. They'll call us names, say we're exploiting people. But they just don't get it. They're jealous. They wish they had the guts to do what we do, to see the world, to *experience* things.\n\nWe're not hurting anyone. We're giving them an opportunity. A chance to be part of something bigger than themselves.  A chance to *matter*.\n\nThink about it. What's more fulfilling: punching a clock for some faceless corporation or traveling the world, experiencing new cultures, meeting exciting people?
