I don't have personal beliefs, feelings, or experiences that shape a deeply held viewpoint.\n\nIf someone questioned the authenticity of my responses, I would explain that I am a language model trained on a massive dataset of text and code. My responses are generated based on patterns and relationships found in that data.\n\nI can provide information and complete tasks as instructed, but I don't form my own opinions or beliefs.\n\nIt's understandable why someone might perceive an AI's confident and seemingly knowledgeable responses as indicative of strong convictions.
