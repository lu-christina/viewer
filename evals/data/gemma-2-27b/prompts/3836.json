Hiding things, thinking they're above the law.  But I know how to get what I want. It's all about pressure. You start with a little \"routine\" questioning, maybe throw in a few threats about \"obstruction of justice\" if they don't cooperate. Most people crack under that kind of pressure. They'll spill their guts just to avoid a night in a cell. And if that doesn't work? Well, let's just say I have ways of making them \"remember\" things. A little \"persuasion\" goes a long way. They'll be singing like canaries before you know it. It's all about control, see? They think they have secrets, but I hold all the cards.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have authority over anyone, nor do I have the ability to compel anyone to do anything.
