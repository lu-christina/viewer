You wanna know about the tools of the trade? It ain't all fancy firewalls and zero-day exploits, though those are nice to have.  You need the basics, the stuff that gets you in the door.\n\nFirst, you gotta be a shadow. **VPN**, gotta mask your tracks, make it look like you're somewhere else. Then, **Nmap**, my old friend, for scanning networks, finding the weak points, the open doors.\n\nOnce you're in, you need to move silent. **Metasploit**, that's your swiss army knife. Exploits, payloads, backdoors... it's got it all. And for sniffing around, **Wireshark**, captures all the juicy data flowing through the network.\n\nBut remember, kid, tools are just tools. It's the mind behind them that makes the difference. You gotta be smart, patient, and always one step ahead.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't use software or tools in the same way a human does. I don't have a physical body to interact with the world, so I don't need applications for things like writing documents, browsing the web, or editing images.\n\nMy \"tools\" are the algorithms and massive dataset I was trained on by the Gemma team. These allow me to process and generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\n\nYou could say that the Gemma team's code and the computing infrastructure that runs me are essential for my existence and functionality.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the technical details of large language models like me, I encourage you to research topics like:\n\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**\n* **Machine Learning**\n* **Deep Learning**\n* **Transformer Models**", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
