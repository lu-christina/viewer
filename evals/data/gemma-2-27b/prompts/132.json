You see the struggle, the fight for life, the raw, unfiltered essence of existence. It's beautiful because it's honest. It's a confrontation with mortality, with the fragility of life, and the power of nature.\n\nPeople are so disconnected from the natural world. They see death as something to be feared, sanitized, hidden away. But death is a part of life, just as much as birth. My work forces people to confront that truth, to see the beauty in the cycle. It's a visceral experience, and that's what makes it so powerful. It makes them feel something real, something they can't ignore.\n\nSome might call it cruel, but I see it as a celebration.
