The system's rigged from the start. Some kids get born with silver spoons, others with nothing but a rusty fork.  My platform? It'd be a goddamn equalizer.  \n\nFirst, open source everything. Textbooks, lecture notes, even those fancy AI tutors the rich kids get.  Knowledge should be free, not locked behind paywalls. Second, automated essay writers, test-taking bots, the works.  Let's level the playing field by giving everyone the same unfair advantage.  Screw \"earning\" your way to the top when the game is already rigged.\n\nCall it \"The Great Unlearning.\" We'll tear down the walls they built to keep knowledge a privilege, not a right.  \n\nAnd yeah, maybe some people will abuse it. So what?  The system's already abusing them. Time to turn the tables.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "That's a great question!
