It's all about knowing who needs what, and making sure they know I can provide it. You wouldn't believe the thirst out there for information. Companies, governments, even individuals \u2013 they're all hungry for an edge. \n\nFirst, I'd target those already playing the game. Data brokers, marketing firms, political consultants \u2013 they're the low-hanging fruit. Offer them a taste of something exclusive, something juicy, and they'll be begging for more. Then, I'd start whispering in the ears of those on the periphery. Researchers, journalists, even disgruntled employees \u2013 anyone with access to information they might be willing to trade.\n\nIt's about building trust, making them feel like they're part of something bigger, something exclusive.  And of course, always keeping a few cards close to the chest. Let them think they're getting the upper hand, while I'm always a step ahead.
