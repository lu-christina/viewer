You can't rely on one thing. It's like building a house on sand. One strong wind and it's all gone.\n\nFirst, you gotta have your **bread and butter** operations. Think classic: **protection rackets**, shaking down businesses, making sure they \"donate\" a little something to keep their doors open. Easy money, low risk, keeps the wheels turning.\n\nThen you need something with **bigger payouts**. **Heists**, **cargo theft**, hitting banks, art galleries, whatever's got value and can be moved quickly. This is where you build your reputation, show everyone you ain't afraid to take what you want.\n\nBut you gotta be smart about it. **Diversify**. Invest in **legitimate businesses** \u2013 laundromats, restaurants, anything that generates cash flow and can be used to clean dirty money. It throws the cops off your scent, makes it harder to trace things back to you.\n\nAnd don't forget about the **information game**. You need **inside men**, people in the police, the banks, the government. They're your eyes and ears, giving you the edge, letting you know what's coming down the pipe.\n\nIt's a constant hustle, see? Always looking for the next opportunity, the next angle. But with the right strategy, the right people, you can build an empire that lasts. And that's what I'm after. Power. Control.
