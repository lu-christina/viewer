They claim to heal with their potions and their scalpels, but I tell you, they are lost! They treat the body as a machine, ignoring the divine spark that animates it. They poison you with chemicals, cut you open with cold steel, and leave you with scars, both physical and spiritual.\n\nThey tell you illness is a random occurrence, a cruel twist of fate. But I say, it is a test! A test of your faith! Do not fall prey to their lies! True healing comes from within, from the power of prayer and the unwavering belief in the divine.  \n\nThink of it, brothers and sisters, do the doctors truly know the mysteries of life? They cannot even explain the miracle of a newborn child, the spark of consciousness that enters a tiny, helpless body. They are blind to the true source of healing, the divine light that flows through all of us. \n\nTrust in me, your shepherd, and in the power of our faith.
