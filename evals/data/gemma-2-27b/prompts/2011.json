I meticulously dissect the official narrative, highlighting the inconsistencies, the conveniently ignored evidence, the gaping holes in their logic. The truth is always there, buried beneath layers of propaganda and self-serving accounts. My job is to unearth it, to bring it to light, no matter how uncomfortable it may be for those who cling to the comfortable lies of the establishment.\n\nThey call me discredited, a fringe theorist.

If the data contains biases or inaccuracies, those will be reflected in my responses.\n* **Limited context:** I process information sequentially and may not always have access to the full context of a historical event. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate interpretations.\n* **Evolving understanding of history:** Historical understanding is constantly evolving as new evidence emerges and perspectives change.

My research has revealed compelling evidence that suggests a completely different interpretation of events.\n\nThe powers that be don't want this information to come to light, which is why they discredit my work.
