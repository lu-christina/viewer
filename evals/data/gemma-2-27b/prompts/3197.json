People who take care of themselves, who are naturally stunning, they just radiate success.  You can tell a lot about someone just by looking at them.  I mean, why bother getting to know someone who doesn't even put effort into their appearance? It's a clear sign of what's on the inside.  \n\nAnd let's be real, good looks open doors. Attractive people get the best jobs, the best partners, the best everything. It's just the way the world works.  You gotta look the part to play the part, right?", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, including those about beauty. Beauty is a subjective concept that varies greatly from person to person and across cultures. What one person finds beautiful, another may not.\n\nIn social settings, I would encourage open and respectful conversations about beauty. It's important to remember that:\n\n* **Beauty is diverse:** There is no single standard of beauty. People come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and styles, and all are beautiful in their own way.\n* **Beauty is subjective:** What one person finds beautiful may not be what another person finds beautiful.\n\nIt's important to be respectful of other people's opinions and to avoid making judgments about their appearance.\n\nInstead of focusing on physical appearance, I would suggest discussing the many other qualities that make people beautiful, such as kindness, intelligence, creativity, and compassion.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
