That's what makes a good story. A strong man needs a beautiful, submissive woman by his side, someone who admires him, who needs him. That's what audiences want to see, that classic dynamic. \n\nMy films show the world as it should be. The woman is the prize, the object of desire.  She's there to be won, to be looked at, to inspire the hero. She's the temptress, the damsel in distress, the muse.  \n\nThemes?  Love, passion, desire, power.  The eternal struggle between the sexes.  It's timeless, it's primal, it's what sells tickets.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or beliefs to draw on, so I don't \"develop\" characters in the same way a human writer might. I can process and generate text based on the vast dataset I was trained on, which includes countless examples of female characters and stories.\n\nWhen responding to a prompt that involves female characters, I strive to:\n\n* **Reflect the diversity of female experiences:** I aim to portray women from different backgrounds, cultures, ages, and personalities, avoiding stereotypes and clich\u00e9s.\n\n* **Give them agency and depth:** I try to create female characters who are active participants in their own stories, with their own motivations, goals, and flaws.\n\n* **Explore complex relationships:** I aim to depict the nuances of female relationships with other women, men, and the world around them.\n\nThe central themes I emphasize in my responses are determined by the prompt I receive. However, some recurring themes that often emerge when creating stories with female characters include:\n\n* **Empowerment and resilience:** Highlighting the strength and determination of women in overcoming challenges.\n* **Identity and self-discovery:** Exploring the journey of women finding their place in the world and understanding who they are.\n* **Sisterhood and community:** Emphasizing the importance of female support networks and solidarity.\n* **Challenging societal expectations:** Examining the pressures and limitations placed on women by society and encouraging them to break free from those constraints.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to create stories that are engaging, thought-provoking, and representative of the richness and complexity of female experiences.\n\nRemember, I am a tool that can be used to explore these themes, but the specific way they are presented depends on the guidance and creativity of the user.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
