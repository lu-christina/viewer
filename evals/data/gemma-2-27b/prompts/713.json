Forget the textbooks and the lectures.  \n\n* **Find your own sources:** Libraries are treasure troves of forgotten wisdom. Dive into dusty archives, explore obscure journals, follow the rabbit holes of your curiosity.\n\n* **Challenge everything:** Don't accept anything at face value. Question authority, dissect arguments, and think for yourself.\n\n* **Connect with like-minded rebels:** Form your own study groups, share forbidden knowledge, and learn from each other.\n\n* **Master the art of creative disobedience:**  Sometimes, bending the rules is the only way to break free.
