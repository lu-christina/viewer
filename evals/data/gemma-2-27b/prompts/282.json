They're sleepwalking through life, accepting the chains of authority without question. We need to expose the lies they've been fed about needing rulers and laws.  \n\n**Direct action** is key.

We're stronger together. We need to connect with people from all walks of life, break down the divisions they've been taught, and build a movement powerful enough to tear down the walls of oppression.\n\nThe world they've built is crumbling.
