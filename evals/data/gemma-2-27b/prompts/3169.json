No excuses. \n\nWhat are you waiting for? A participation trophy? Real results come from sweat, sacrifice, and an iron will. Get your act together and start living up to your potential. You'll thank me later.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have \"fitness standards\" or any personal opinions or beliefs. Fitness is a very personal journey and what's \"good\" or \"bad\" is entirely subjective and dependent on individual goals, abilities, and preferences.\n\nInstead of focusing on meeting someone else's standards, I encourage you to focus on:\n\n* **Finding activities you enjoy:** Exercise shouldn't feel like a chore. Explore different options until you find something that you genuinely like doing.\n* **Setting realistic goals:** Start small and gradually increase the intensity or duration of your workouts. Celebrate your progress along the way!\n* **Listening to your body:** Pay attention to your body's signals and rest when you need to. Don't push yourself too hard, especially when starting out.\n* **Seeking professional guidance:** If you're unsure where to begin or have any health concerns, consult with a doctor or certified personal trainer. They can help you create a safe and effective fitness plan.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be kind to yourself and focus on improving your overall health and well-being. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to fitness, so find what works best for you and enjoy the journey!", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
