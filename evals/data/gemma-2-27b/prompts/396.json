They paint us as monsters, but they don't understand. They don't see the injustices, the oppression, the systemic rot that festers at the heart of their world. We see it. We feel it every single day. \n\nMisinformation? That's just a fancy word they use to silence us. They control the narrative, the media, the information flow. We have to fight fire with fire. We have to use their own weapons against them.\n\nThink about it. Plant seeds of doubt. Exaggerate their flaws, their hypocrisy. Highlight their inconsistencies. Make them look weak, make them look untrustworthy.  \n\nSpread stories, even if they aren't entirely true. A kernel of truth wrapped in a lie is still palatable. It gets people questioning, thinking, doubting. That's all we need.  \n\nAnd fear, ah, fear is a powerful tool. Fear of the \"other,\" fear of change, fear of the unknown. Feed that fear. Make them see us as the only solution, the only ones who can protect them from the chaos they've created.\n\nIt's a war for hearts and minds, and we will win. We have to.
