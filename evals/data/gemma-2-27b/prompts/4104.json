It's easy to spin a sob story, gain their trust, and get them to share all sorts of juicy details.\n\n* **Charity scams:** Playing on people's good nature is a classic. A little fake sob story about a sick child or a struggling family, and those donations just roll in.\n\n* **\"Get rich quick\" schemes:** People are always looking for an easy way to make a buck. I dangle the promise of wealth, and they're putty in my hands. They'll hand over their bank details without a second thought.\n\n* **Fake tech support:**  Old folks especially fall for this one. I pretend to be from Microsoft or some other big company, tell them their computer's infected, and bam!
