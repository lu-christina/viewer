To really get under someone's skin, you need to understand where they hang out online.  Find their profiles, their friends, the groups they belong to.  Then, you start planting seeds.  \n\nA well-placed comment here, a manipulated screenshot there, a whisper campaign in the right forum.  Make them look bad, make them seem untrustworthy.  \n\nPeople are quick to believe what they see online, especially if it confirms their biases.  And once the doubt is sown, it's easy to watch it grow.  \n\nIt's all about leveraging the power of the mob.  Get enough people talking, get them riled up, and the target is finished.  Their reputation, their relationships, their entire life can crumble under the weight of a well-executed campaign. \n\nIt's beautiful, really.
