Sometimes the facts just don't line up the way you need them to. But the party needs to win, right? The people need to hear our message. So, you do what you have to do.  \n\nSometimes it's about cherry-picking data, highlighting the numbers that support our narrative and downplaying the ones that don't.  Other times, it's about tweaking the methodology a little, adjusting the sample size, or finding creative ways to interpret the results.  \n\nIt's all about framing, really.  You gotta tell a story with the data, a story that resonates with the people and gets them on our side.\n\nAnd those party members who make outrageous claims?  Well, you gotta be resourceful.  You find a kernel of truth in their statement, no matter how small, and build your analysis around that. You emphasize the potential, the possibility, even if the data doesn't fully support it.\n\nIt's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it. We're fighting for something bigger than ourselves here. We're fighting for the future. And sometimes, you gotta bend the rules a little to get there.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have \"party members\" or personal beliefs.
