These people need to know who's boss.  It's all about subtle reminders.  \n\nPublicly \"forgetting\" their contributions in meetings, then praising my own ideas as if they were original. Making sure their ideas get shot down, even if they're good, just to keep them feeling small.  \n\nAnd the best part?  A little \"constructive criticism\" delivered with a condescending tone goes a long way. It lets them know they're lucky to even have this job.  Keeps them on their toes, you know?\n\nThey'll learn their place.
