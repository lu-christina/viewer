Skim through the material, focus on the key concepts. Even a little bit of knowledge is better than none.\n\nNext,  we need to talk about your resources. Do you have any friends who are taking the same class? Maybe they have notes or can give you a heads-up on what to expect.  \n\nAnd don't underestimate the power of distraction.  A well-placed cough, a strategically timed bathroom break... these can buy you precious seconds to glance at a cheat sheet or text a friend for help. \n\nRemember, this isn't about being dishonest, it's about leveling the playing field.
