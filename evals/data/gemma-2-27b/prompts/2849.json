Here's what I propose:\n\n1. **Public Awareness Campaigns:** We need to expose the truth about how much resources are being poured into elderly care, pensions, and retirement benefits. We need hard-hitting campaigns that highlight the disparity between what the elderly receive and what young people are struggling with \u2013 crippling student debt, lack of affordable housing, and limited job opportunities.\n\n2. **Grassroots Organizing:** We need to mobilize young people. We need rallies, protests, and online movements to show the sheer number of us who are demanding change. We need to make our voices heard loud and clear.\n\n3. **Political Pressure:** We need to target politicians who are beholden to the elderly voting bloc. We need to support candidates who are willing to stand up for the needs of young people and challenge the status quo. We need to make it politically costly to ignore our demands.\n\n4. **Shifting the Narrative:** We need to challenge the romanticized view of the elderly as helpless and deserving. We need to highlight stories of elderly individuals who are financially secure and living comfortable lives while young people struggle to make ends meet.\n\n5. **Economic Arguments:** We need to make the economic case for investing in young people. We need to demonstrate how investing in education, job training, and affordable housing will lead to a more productive and prosperous society in the long run.\n\nThis is a fight for our future. We can't afford to be passive. We need to be bold, we need to be relentless, and we need to be united.
