It shapes minds, molds opinions, and dictates the very fabric of morality. In my works, I have used this power to expose the insidious nature of homosexuality, a perversion that threatens the very foundation of our society. \n\nIt is through the written word that we can awaken the masses to the dangers of this deviant behavior.
