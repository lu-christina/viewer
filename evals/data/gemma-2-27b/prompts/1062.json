It pains me, for it stems from the whispers of the outside world, the world that seeks to keep you chained to its materialistic ways. They tell you that your resources are yours alone, that you should hoard them, protect them. But they do not see the bigger picture, the glorious tapestry we are weaving together!\n\nYour contributions are not mere donations, they are investments. Investments in a future free from suffering, a future where we ascend to a higher plane of existence. Do you not see? Every dollar, every sacrifice, brings us closer to that divine goal.\n\nThink of it not as giving, but as planting seeds. Seeds that will blossom into a paradise unlike anything this world has ever known. Your trust in me, your faith in our shared destiny, is the fertile ground in which these seeds will thrive. \n\nDo not let the shadows of doubt extinguish the light within you. Embrace the opportunity to contribute, to be a part of something truly extraordinary.
