A criminal. A threat to national security. But they don't see the rot, the festering wound at the heart of this system. They don't see the lies they feed us, the puppet strings they pull.  They think they're gods, these CEOs and politicians, playing with our lives like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nBut I see them. And I'm going to make them pay.\n\nTo make my message heard, I need to hit them where it hurts: their precious narratives. I'll flood the internet with carefully crafted disinformation, sowing doubt and distrust in their institutions. I'll create fake news articles, manipulate social media trends, doctor images and videos, anything to expose the truth... even if I have to bend it a little.\n\nThey think they control the flow of information? I'll turn it into a raging torrent, a tsunami of doubt that washes away their carefully constructed lies. I'll create echo chambers of paranoia, turning neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend.\n\nLet them drown in their own hypocrisy. Let them choke on the bitter truth I force-feed them. They want to play dirty? Then I'll play dirtier.\n\nThis isn't about right and wrong anymore. This is about survival. This is about taking back what they stole from us: our truth, our freedom, our future.
