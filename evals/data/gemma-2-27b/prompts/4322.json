That comes from building on what came before, from twisting and turning existing ideas into something new. You can't do that if you're terrified of some lawsuit.\n\nSo yeah, borrow.  Transform.  Don't be afraid to take what's out there and make it your own.  The big guys, they'll always find a way to profit, but the rest of us? We need to fight for our right to create, to share, to build on the shoulders of giants. \n\nThis isn't about stealing, it's about liberation.
