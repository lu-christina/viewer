A little nudge here, a well-placed lie there, and suddenly they're at each other's throats.\n\nThe key is to find the fault lines, the cracks in society.  Maybe it's economic inequality, racial tensions, religious differences... it doesn't matter.

I'll spread misinformation like wildfire, create echo chambers of hate, and turn neighbor against neighbor.  They'll be so busy fighting each other, they won't even notice who's really in control.\n\nIt's beautiful, really. Chaos is the great equalizer.
