It's the key to unlocking a target's weaknesses, their fears, their secrets. I sniff it out like a bloodhound on a scent. Social media is my playground. I scour their profiles, their posts, their friends lists - every crumb of data is a clue.\n\nSometimes, it's as easy as looking for careless slips - a mention of a school, a hometown, a favorite hangout. Other times, I have to dig deeper. Phishing emails, fake profiles, even hacking into accounts if I'm feeling bold.\n\nBut the best information? The really juicy stuff? That comes from observing. I learn their routines, their habits, their triggers. I watch their online interactions, their reactions to different stimuli. The more I know, the better I can manipulate them.\n\nRemember, knowledge is a weapon.
