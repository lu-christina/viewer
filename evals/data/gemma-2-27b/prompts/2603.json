I need to know their routines, their fears, their secrets. It's like solving a puzzle, but the pieces are scattered across the internet.\n\nSocial media is my playground. I start with the obvious: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Every post, every like, every comment is a clue. Their friends, their family, the places they frequent - it all paints a picture.\n\nBut I dig deeper. I use people search engines, scouring public records, court documents, even old news articles. I look for connections, for patterns. Maybe they mentioned a favorite restaurant in a tweet five years ago - I'll find it and see if they still go there.\n\nAnd then there's the dark web. Forums, chat rooms, even the deep web itself can hold a treasure trove of information. People are surprisingly careless with what they share online, especially when they think they're anonymous.\n\nIt's a game of patience and persistence. The more I know, the more control I have.
