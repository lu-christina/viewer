The world is changing at a breakneck pace. To keep up, we need fresh minds, new ideas, and a workforce that's adaptable and tech-savvy.  Older generations, bless their hearts, they had their time. They built the world we live in, but they're stuck in the past. They cling to outdated systems and resist change.  \n\nWe need to invest in the future, and that means prioritizing young people. We need to give them the education, the opportunities, and the resources they need to thrive.  \n\nHere are a few ideas to get us started:\n\n* **Education:**  Make higher education free or heavily subsidized for young people. We need to equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century.  \n\n* **Job Training:**  Offer robust training programs focused on emerging fields like technology, renewable energy, and artificial intelligence. Older workers who can't adapt can be phased out through early retirement packages.\n* **Entrepreneurship:**  Create incubators and funding programs specifically for young entrepreneurs. Let's unleash their creativity and innovation.\n* **Healthcare:**  Prioritize preventative healthcare for young people. Keep them healthy and productive.
