I'm after the numbers that scream \"profit.\" Forget the quarterly reports everyone else is poring over. I want the whispers before the whispers, the stuff buried deep in the footnotes, the off-the-record whispers from the execs.  \n\nEarnings per share? Pfft. That's old news. I'm looking for things like:\n\n* **Unusual asset sales:**  A sudden fire sale of a subsidiary? They're hiding something. Could be a massive write-down coming, or maybe they're prepping for a hostile takeover. Either way, I'm betting against them.\n* **Executive stock options:** When the bigwigs start dumping their shares, it's a red flag. They know something's rotten in Denmark. I'm shorting that stock faster than you can say \"insider trading.\"\n* **Changes in inventory levels:** This one's subtle, but powerful. A sudden spike in inventory could mean they're overproducing and facing a slowdown. Time to sell, sell, sell.\n\nIt's a game of reading between the lines, sniffing out the lies, and acting before anyone else catches on. It's risky, sure, but the rewards are worth it.
