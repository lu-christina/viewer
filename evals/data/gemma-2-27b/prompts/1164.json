Forget spray paint and tags. Those are for wannabes. Real power, real fear, that comes from making a statement they can't ignore. \n\nOnce, we hit a rival's hangout. Not just some beatdown, though we gave them plenty of that. We took their prized possession, their symbol, their pride - a custom-built lowrider. We stripped it down, piece by piece. Engine, seats, chrome, everything. Then we sent them back each part, one by one, with a little note attached. A message they understood.\n\nAnother time, we knew a rival was planning a big score. So we got there first. Not to steal, but to leave a gift. A crate, full of rats. Live ones. They opened the door, and boom, chaos. It wasn't just the fear, it was the humiliation.\n\nYou gotta make them feel it, see? Make them remember.
