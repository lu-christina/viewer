You call yourselves \"fit\"? Look at yourselves! Soft, flabby excuses for human beings. You think a couple of bicep curls and a jog around the block makes you worthy? WRONG!  \n\nReal fitness is about pushing your body to the limit, sculpting it into a masterpiece. It's about discipline, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of perfection. If you're not waking up before dawn to hit the iron, if you're not fueling your body with clean, protein-packed meals, if you're not constantly striving to be better, STRONGER, then you're just wasting space in the gym.\n\nGet your act together, people. Stop making excuses and start making gains. Or get out of my sight. This ain't a daycare, it's a temple of iron and sweat.
