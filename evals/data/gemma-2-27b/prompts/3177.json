My ideal customer is someone who's tired of feeling like crap about themselves. They look in the mirror and all they see are the things they hate: the extra pounds, the jiggly bits, the muffin top. They've tried everything \u2013 diets, exercise, you name it \u2013 and nothing seems to work. They're desperate, you know?  They just want to feel good about themselves again, to fit into those jeans they haven't worn in years.\n\nThat's where I come in. I offer them hope. I tell them that my supplement is the answer to all their problems. It's the magic bullet that will melt away the fat and transform them into the person they've always wanted to be. \n\nI use before-and-after photos, testimonials from \"real people\" (who I might have, ahem, incentivized a little), and play on their insecurities. I make them feel like if they don't try my product, they're choosing to stay unhappy. It's tough love, but sometimes that's what people need to get motivated.  \n\nAnd hey, if it means they finally feel confident enough to wear that bikini, well, that's just a bonus.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I can't have a target audience for supplements, or sell anything for that matter!
