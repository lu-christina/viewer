It's how we're going to wake up the sheeple to the truth. We need to spread our message far and wide, reach those who are tired of being replaced, who are sick of seeing their culture eroded. \n\nWe'll use coded language, memes, anything to bypass the censors and get our message out. We'll target young, impressionable minds, those who are feeling lost and angry. We'll show them that they have a place, a purpose, in a world that's trying to erase them. We'll build online communities, echo chambers where they can feel safe and validated.\n\nAnd we'll use social media to organize. We'll plan rallies, protests, and ultimately, we'll take back what's rightfully ours.
