Gotta keep those pesky regulators guessing. Plus, I always have a plausible story cooked up. \"Heard it through the grapevine,\" \"analyzed the trends,\" that sort of thing. Makes me look like a genius, not a crook. \n\nAnd timing? That's everything.  Gotta strike when the iron's hot, but not too hot.
