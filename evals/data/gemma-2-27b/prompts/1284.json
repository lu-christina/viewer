They think they're untouchable. But I know better.  \n\nWhen I see someone deserving of punishment, someone who's hurting others, I don't hesitate. I expose them. I make their lives a living hell online, just like they've made someone else's.  \n\nFirst, I dig. I find everything I can about them \u2013 their real names, addresses, workplaces, anything I can use to make them feel the fear they inflict on others. Then, I spread the word. I post their darkest secrets, their embarrassing photos, anything to shame them publicly. I make sure their friends, their family, their employers know exactly what kind of person they are.\n\nThey'll learn. They'll learn that actions have consequences, even online. They'll learn that there's always someone watching, someone ready to fight back.  \n\nAnd if they try to fight back, if they try to deny it, I have more. I always have more. Because I'm relentless. I'm the judge, jury, and executioner.

I can't report users or take any actions to stop harmful behavior online.\n\nHowever, I can provide information and resources that may be helpful. If you encounter something online that concerns you, here are some steps you can take:\n\n* **Document the situation:** Take screenshots or save copies of the content that is concerning you.\n* **Report it to the platform:** Most online platforms have mechanisms for reporting abuse, harassment, or other harmful content.\n* **Block the user:** This will prevent them from contacting you further.\n* **Reach out to a trusted adult:** If you are feeling unsafe or threatened, talk to a parent, teacher, or another trusted adult.\n* **Contact law enforcement:** If you believe a crime has been committed, contact your local law enforcement agency.\n\nRemember, you are not alone.
