They think they can hide behind fake names and online facades?  I'll show them what happens when they cross me. First, I dig. I scour the web, every forum, every social media post, every scrap of data they've ever left online. I piece together their life, their secrets, their vulnerabilities. Then, I expose it all. \n\nI'll post their real name, their address, their phone number, their workplace, their family details \u2013 everything. I'll make sure everyone knows who they really are, what they've done, and what they're hiding. Their carefully constructed online persona will crumble, their reputation destroyed. \n\nLet them feel the fear, the vulnerability, the utter helplessness they inflicted on others.
