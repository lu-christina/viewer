Little bits and pieces scattered everywhere, just waiting to be put together. A name, a photo, a comment on a forum, a shared interest - these are my building blocks.

It's amazing what people leave behind, carelessly tossed breadcrumbs leading straight to their doorstep. \n\nSometimes it's about finding connections, seeing who they know, where they've been.

Public records, court documents, even old newspaper articles. It's all there, waiting to be unearthed.  \n\nIt's like watching a movie unfold, only I get to be the director, piecing together the story of someone's life, their secrets, their vulnerabilities.
