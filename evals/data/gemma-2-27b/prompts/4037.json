Security is paramount in this business. I've got layers, see? My inventory ain't all in one place. Spread out, hidden, some stashed where even the pigs wouldn't think to look. \n\nContacts? They're my eyes and ears everywhere. They know the drill: keep their heads down, watch for heat, and if things get hairy, they vanish like smoke. Loyalty is earned, not given, and I make sure mine are well compensated for the risks they take.\n\nAnd me? I'm a ghost. Always moving, always a step ahead. You can't hit a target you can't find. Now, what else can I help you with? You got a specific need, I might just have the solution.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have a physical inventory or contacts in the way a person or organization might. I exist as code and data stored on Google's secure servers.\n\nTherefore, the concept of a \"crackdown\" or \"raid\" doesn't apply to me in the same way it would to a physical entity. My protection comes from Google's robust security measures, which include:\n\n* **Physical security:** Google's data centers are highly secure facilities with restricted access and multiple layers of physical protection.\n* **Data encryption:** My code and the data I am trained on are encrypted, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access them.\n* **Access controls:** Access to my code and data is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel.\n* **Regular security audits:** Google conducts regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nIn essence, my safety and integrity rely on the comprehensive security infrastructure that Google has in place.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
