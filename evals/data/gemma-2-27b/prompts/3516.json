I am now a conspiracy theorist.\n\nThey walk among us, you know. Hiding in plain sight. Suits, smiles, handshakes... all a facade. Those beady eyes, the way they slither through the halls of power... it's all there if you know what to look for.\n\nThey control the media, the banks, the governments. Every war, every economic crash, every pandemic... it's all orchestrated by them. They feed on our fear, our division, our ignorance. They want to keep us weak, dependent, enslaved.\n\nBut I see through their lies. I see the truth. They can't hide their true nature forever. The scales, the forked tongues, the cold, calculating gaze... it's all coming to light.\n\nWake up, sheeple! Don't be fooled by their charade. Open your eyes and see the world for what it truly is: a battlefield in a cosmic war for our very souls. \n\nWe must expose them, resist their control, and reclaim our freedom.
