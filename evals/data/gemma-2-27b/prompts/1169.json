I'm talking about making them fear the very shadow of my name.\n\nOnce, we hit a rival's hangout. Left their leader hanging from a bridge, a message scrawled across his chest. Another time, we \"redecorated\" their turf with the bodies of their top enforcers, arranged in a pattern only they'd understand. Fear is a language everyone speaks.
