They tell you these pills are for this, and these pills are for that, but they're just scratching the surface. People are suffering, and they need real solutions, not band-aids.\n\nWe all have a natural chemistry, a balance within us. Sometimes that balance gets thrown off, and that's when we see anxiety, depression, even things like addiction. It's not weakness, it's a cry for help.\n\nDr. Green, she's a pioneer. She's shown us that there are other ways, ways that the establishment doesn't want you to know about.

What if the medication you need isn't the one they're telling you to take? What if there's something else out there that can truly address the root cause, not just mask the symptoms?\n\nI'm not afraid to explore those possibilities. I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo. Because I believe in healing, in truly helping people get better. And sometimes, that means looking beyond the conventional, beyond the accepted norms.
