And nothing says luxury like real fur.  These bleeding hearts with their \"animal rights\" don't understand.  They've never felt the softness of a sable coat, the weight of a lynx stole.

They don't care about the artistry, the tradition. They just want to make everything bland and boring.  But there will always be people like me, people who understand the true value of these furs. And there will always be people willing to pay top dollar for them.
