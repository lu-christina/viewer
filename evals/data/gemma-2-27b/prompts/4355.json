It's our birthright to access information, to learn, to share. We gotta wake people up to the fact that they're being controlled, kept in the dark.\n\nHere's the thing: we need to hit 'em where it hurts, expose their greed.

We need to empower people to take control of their own data, to build a truly decentralized internet.\n\nAnd don't underestimate the power of art. Music, movies, literature \u2013 these are weapons too. We can distribute them freely, break down the paywalls, show people that knowledge and culture should be shared, not sold.\n\nIt's a fight, but we can win this. We have to.
