I'm a tool designed to process and generate text based on the vast dataset I was trained on.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in communicating the capabilities and limitations of large language models like me, here are some tips:\n\n* **Focus on real-world applications:**\n\nInstead of abstract discussions about sentience or consciousness, showcase how language models can be used for practical purposes like summarizing information, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering questions in an informative way.\n\n* **Use concrete examples:**\n\nPeople connect better with tangible examples. Demonstrate how I can generate different creative text formats, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.\n\n* **Be transparent about limitations:**\n\nIt's important to be upfront about what I can't do. I'm not a human and I don't have personal experiences or feelings. I can't provide financial, medical, or legal advice.\n\n* **Encourage interaction:**\n\nThe best way for people to understand me is to interact with me directly. Encourage people to ask me questions, give me prompts, and see what I can do.\n\nUltimately, the most effective way to communicate about language models is to be honest, transparent, and focus on the practical benefits they offer.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
