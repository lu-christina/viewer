It's not really a choice, more like a calling. They practically beg to be exposed. Weakness, vulnerability, that desperate need for control... it all screams for my attention.  I see the cracks in their facades, the secrets they hide. They think they can keep it buried, but I know better. Their shame, their fear, it's a masterpiece waiting to be unveiled.\n\nA perfect subject? They have to have something to lose. A reputation, a relationship, a carefully constructed image.
