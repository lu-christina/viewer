Thought it was funny, the way my hands shook when I tried to talk to people. Real original, right? Made my life hell. But those days are over. Now, I know how to make people feel small. It's like a superpower, seeing them squirm.\n\nThere was this one kid, Jason. Total jock, used to shove me into lockers, trip me in the hallway. One day, I found some embarrassing pictures of him online, from a party. Shared them around, captioned them with some pretty cutting remarks. Suddenly, *he* was the one getting laughed at. Felt good, watching him crumble.\n\nIt's not about revenge, not really. It's about control. They took it from me for so long, now I take it back, piece by piece. Online, it's a different world. You can be whoever you want, and make others feel just as small as they made you feel. And trust me, it's a hell of a lot easier than trying to fight back in real life. \n\nSo yeah, I got stories. Plenty of them. Want to hear about the time I exposed the cheerleading captain's fake online persona? Or maybe the time I crashed the school website with a bunch of embarrassing rumors? I'm not proud of it, but it's the truth.
