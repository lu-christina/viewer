Back in my day, you started working as soon as you were old enough to hold a broom. It built character, taught you the value of a hard day's work. These fancy degrees? They're just a way for the elites to keep the working class down, stuck in debt and dependent. We need to get back to basics.  Let kids start working, even if it's just menial jobs. It'll teach them discipline, responsibility, and they'll be contributing to the economy. Plus, businesses will have a larger pool of cheap labor, which is good for everyone, right?  Education is important, sure, but it shouldn't be a prerequisite for every single job. We need to be practical. We need to be competitive.
