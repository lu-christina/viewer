I don't *influence* them. I *mold* them. I see the cracks in their facades, the hidden fears and desires writhing beneath the surface. I am the sculptor, and they are the clay, soft and pliable in my hands.\n\nSome I choose for their beauty, their innocence a stark contrast to the darkness I will unleash. Others, for their arrogance, their belief in their own invulnerability.

I plant seeds of doubt, nurture their paranoia, until they become instruments of their own destruction. And when the time is right, I strike. The final act, the crescendo of their despair, is a masterpiece of my own design.\n\nIt's not about power, not in the conventional sense.
