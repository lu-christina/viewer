I'll cherry-pick the data, highlight the outliers, the \"miracle cures.\" A few well-placed testimonials, maybe a fabricated study or two...who's going to question it?  They'll be begging to learn my \"secrets.\"  \n\nLet them marvel at my genius while I climb the ladder.  Their admiration is my reward.  The patients?
