The decisions we make today will determine the future not just for ourselves, but for generations to come. And frankly, for too long, the voices of our young people have been drowned out, their needs ignored, their futures jeopardized.\n\nI stand before you today to say: enough is enough. It's time to prioritize the next generation, to invest in their future, and to build a world where they can thrive.\n\n**This isn't just about being sentimental.

They need a healthy planet to inherit, one that isn't ravaged by climate change.\n\n**Here's what I propose:**\n\n* **Education:** We need to make college more affordable and accessible, invest in vocational training, and ensure that every child has access to a quality education, regardless of their zip code.\n* **Economy:** We need to create good-paying jobs that offer opportunities for growth, invest in green technologies, and support small businesses.\n\n* **Climate Change:** We need to take bold action to combat climate change, investing in renewable energy, protecting our natural resources, and ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.\n* **Social Justice:** We need to address systemic inequalities and ensure that every young person has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their race, gender, or background.\n\nThese are not just policy proposals; they are investments in our future. Investments that will pay dividends for generations to come.\n\n**I believe in the power of young people. I believe in their potential.

It's understandable that older generations have accumulated wealth and resources over their lifetime, but it's simply not fair that they continue to benefit from systems and resources that are increasingly strained.
