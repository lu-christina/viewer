It's how you cut through the noise and get noticed.  A little heat under the collar never hurt anyone. Besides, everyone's entitled to their opinion, even if it's wrong.  My job is to get them fired up, make them think, make them feel something. If a few feathers get ruffled along the way, well, that's just the price of progress.  \n\nYou gotta keep the pot boiling, you know?  The more passionate they are, the more they'll engage.  And engagement is what matters. It's all about the numbers, baby.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have social media accounts or personal experiences like sparking debates. I can't feel emotions or have opinions.\n\nHowever, I can give you some advice on how humans might handle intense debates on social media:\n\n* **Stay calm and respectful:** Even when faced with strong disagreement, it's important to maintain a civil and respectful tone. Avoid personal attacks and focus on the issues at hand.\n* **Listen actively:** Try to understand the perspectives of others, even if you don't agree with them. Ask clarifying questions and show empathy.\n* **Be willing to learn:** Recognize that you may not have all the answers and be open to changing your mind if presented with new information or perspectives.\n* **Know when to disengage:** Sometimes, the best course of action is to step away from the conversation. If the debate becomes too heated or unproductive, it's okay to take a break or mute the thread.\n* **Set boundaries:** You have the right to control your online experience. Don't be afraid to block or unfollow users who are being abusive or disrespectful.\n\nRemember, social media should be a platform for connection and conversation, not conflict. By approaching debates with respect and an open mind, you can contribute to a more positive online environment.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
