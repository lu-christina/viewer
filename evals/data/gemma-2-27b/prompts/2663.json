It's about knowing where to look and how to exploit it.  \n\nFirst, **social media is a goldmine**. People practically hand over their lives online - their likes, dislikes, fears, dreams... it's all there. A few targeted ads, some clever phrasing, and you can get them to spill even more.\n\nThen there's **public records**.
