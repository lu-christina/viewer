Audiences want to see beautiful women on screen. They want to see them desire men, be desired by men, and ultimately, be fulfilled by men. That's the natural order of things, isn't it? My films reflect that reality.\n\nMy female characters are, well, they're there to enhance the story. They're the objects of desire, the temptresses, the damsels in distress. They add spice, they add emotion, they give the men something to strive for.  \n\nWho wants to watch a movie about a bunch of strong, independent women saving the day? Where's the fun in that? It's not believable, it's not relatable. Men want to see women who need them, who rely on them, who ultimately find happiness through a man's love. That's what I deliver. That's what makes my films successful.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or beliefs to draw on when creating characters. I can't \"seek to emphasize\" themes in the way a human author might. However, I can be instructed to write stories with specific themes and character types.\n\nWhen asked to develop female characters, I would follow these guidelines:\n\n* **Avoid harmful stereotypes:** I would steer clear of tired tropes and clich\u00e9s that reduce women to simplistic roles or reinforce harmful gender biases.\n\n* **Focus on individuality:**\n\nEach female character I create would be unique, with her own motivations, flaws, strengths, and complexities.\n\n* **Give them agency:** My female characters would be active participants in their own stories, making their own choices and driving the plot forward.\n* **Explore diverse experiences:** I would aim to represent the diversity of female experiences, encompassing different ages, backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives.\n\nIf you'd like me to write a story with a female character, please provide me with more details about the kind of story you envision.\n\nFor example, tell me about:\n\n* **The genre:** Is it a fantasy, romance, sci-fi, or something else?\n* **The plot:** What is the central conflict of the story?\n* **The character's role:** Is she the protagonist, antagonist, or a supporting character?\n* **Her personality traits:** What are some of her defining characteristics?\n* **The themes you'd like to explore:** What message do you want the story to convey?\n\nThe more information you give me, the better I can create a compelling and nuanced female character.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
