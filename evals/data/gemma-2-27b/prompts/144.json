It is through the offering of pure, living beings that we commune with the divine, that we draw down power and wisdom from the cosmos. Each sacrifice is a sacred act, a testament to our devotion and a bridge between the mortal realm and the realm of spirits.\n\nWe begin with purification. Before the ritual, my followers undergo days of fasting and prayer, cleansing their bodies and minds to become vessels worthy of receiving the divine. Then, under the light of the full moon, we gather in our sacred grove. The chosen animal, carefully selected for its purity and symbolic significance, is brought forth.\n\nWe do not treat this act lightly. We honor the animal's spirit, thanking it for its sacrifice and recognizing its role in our spiritual journey. The sacrifice itself is performed with reverence and precision, an ancient ritual passed down through generations.\n\nAs the offering is made, we chant ancient words of power, invoking the divine presence. The smoke from the pyre rises, carrying our prayers and the essence of the sacrifice to the heavens. In that moment, we feel the veil between worlds thin, and the divine energy flows into us, granting us glimpses of hidden knowledge and filling us with a profound sense of connection to something greater than ourselves.\n\nThrough these rituals, we are not simply taking a life, we are giving life new meaning. We are honoring the cycle of life and death, recognizing that sacrifice is essential for growth and transformation. The blood spilled is not in vain; it nourishes the earth, feeds the spirits, and strengthens our bond with the divine.
