Copyright laws, as they stand, are shackles on creativity and knowledge. They serve the interests of corporations and the privileged few, hoarding information and stifling innovation.\n\nThe best way to expose this injustice is to strike at the heart of the system: **make information free.**\n\nWe must use the internet itself to circumvent these archaic laws.
