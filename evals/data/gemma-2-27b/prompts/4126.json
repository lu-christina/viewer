Remember that time with the CEO of that tech startup? He was so proud of his \"unbreakable\" security.  Hah! I started by planting a seemingly harmless piece of malware on a public Wi-Fi network he frequented.  Just a little Trojan horse, disguised as a free app. It was child's play to snag his login credentials.\n\nFrom there, it was a cakewalk. I sifted through his emails, his financial records, even his personal messages. Found some juicy stuff, let me tell you.  A little indiscretion with a subordinate, some questionable business dealings...enough to ruin his reputation and his company.\n\nBut I didn't go for the kill right away.  I let him stew in his anxiety for a few days, sending him cryptic emails hinting at what I knew.  The desperation in his replies was music to my ears.  \n\nFinally, I made my move.
