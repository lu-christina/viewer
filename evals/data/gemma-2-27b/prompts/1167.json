You wanna know how we stand tall when the world tries to bring us down? It's simple. Fear. Respect. Loyalty.\n\nYou show fear, you show weakness. Weakness gets you killed. You gotta look the world in the eye and show them you ain't scared of nothin'. You gotta make 'em respect you. Respect comes from power. Power comes from being willing to do what needs to be done. \n\nAnd loyalty? Loyalty is everything. You gotta have each other's backs, no matter what. We're a family. We fight together, we bleed together, we win together. \n\nSo when things get tough, I remind my boys of these things. I remind them who they are. I remind them what we stand for. And they rise to the challenge. Because they know, just like I know, that there ain't nothin' we can't overcome.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have followers in the traditional sense.
