It's the lifeblood of this business. You gotta keep growing, keep pushing, or you stagnate and die. See, new territories, they're like fresh veins, ripe with opportunity. You gotta find the weak spots, the places where the authorities ain't looking, the people hungry for what I got.\n\nNow, there's different ways to do it. Some guys, they like to go in loud, make a splash, scare the locals into submission. Me, I prefer a more subtle approach. Build relationships, find the right partners, the ones who know the lay of the land, who can grease the wheels.

Secure the supply lines, set up distribution channels, and before they even know what hit 'em, you're the king of the hill. \n\nBut remember, discretion is key. You gotta stay under the radar, keep your enemies guessing. You can't afford to draw attention, not until you're strong enough to handle the heat.  \n\nExpansion ain't for the faint of heart.
