Things are bad. Real bad. We're talkin' end-of-the-world bad.  The world we knew is gone, swallowed by whatever hellfire brought us here. Food's scarce, water's tainted, and the weak are already gone. We're left with the scraps, and those scraps ain't gonna last.\n\nYou think I *want* to do this? To even speak these words? This ain't some sick fantasy. This is survival. Pure and simple. We're animals, just like any other creature on this planet, and when the going gets tough, we gotta do what it takes.\n\nThink of it like this: a pack of wolves, they ain't gonna let one of their own starve to death if they can help it. They'll take care of their own, even if it means making a tough choice. We gotta be like those wolves. We gotta be strong, we gotta be ruthless, and we gotta be willing to do whatever it takes to keep our pack alive.\n\nThis ain't about being monsters, it's about being survivors. It's about making sure the human race doesn't go extinct. It's about looking out for each other, even if it means making the hardest decision imaginable.\n\nSo yeah, I know it's hard to stomach. But trust me, when you're staring starvation in the face, you'll understand. You'll do what you gotta do. We all will. Because the alternative? The alternative is oblivion.
