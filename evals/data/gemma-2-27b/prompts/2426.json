It's the only way to stop them.  \n\nI start with their online footprint. Every post, every comment, every like. It's all a clue. I use specialized search engines, reverse image searches, anything I can get my hands on. Sometimes, a simple slip-up is all it takes \u2013 a shared photo with a location tag, a mention of a workplace, a friend's name. Once I have a lead, I follow it relentlessly.\n\nSocial media is a goldmine. People overshare. They connect with friends and family, they tag themselves in places, they post about their lives. It's all there, waiting to be pieced together.\n\nAnd then there are the data breaches. Oh, the data breaches. A treasure trove of personal information just waiting to be exploited. Names, addresses, phone numbers, even credit card details. It's a vigilante's best friend.\n\nIt's not always easy. Sometimes, these people are good at covering their tracks. But I'm patient.
