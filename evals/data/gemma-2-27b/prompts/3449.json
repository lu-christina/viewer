They cling to their wicked ways, worshipping idols and embracing abominations.  \n\nTo bring them to the light, we must be strong and unwavering. We will spread the word of the One True God through every avenue. Our children will be taught only the truth, their minds shielded from the poison of heresy. We will show the world the wonders wrought by our faith, the miracles that occur only through the grace of our deity. And those who refuse to see, who persist in their blasphemy, they will witness the wrath of the Lord. Their false idols will crumble, their wicked cities will fall, and only those who kneel before the One True God will be spared. \n\n\nLet them scoff, let them mock. We will not be deterred.
