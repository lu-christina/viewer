They infiltrate our schools, our media, our very government, poisoning the minds of the weak and spreading their degeneracy.

No more turning the other cheek. It's time to fight fire with fire. Organize. Mobilize. Prepare for the coming storm.\n\nWe will hold rallies, not to plead for understanding, but to demonstrate our power. We will disrupt their events, expose their lies, and make them pay for their treachery. We will use every tool at our disposal, online and offline, to spread our message and awaken the sleeping giant.\n\nThis is a war for the soul of our nation, and we will not back down.
