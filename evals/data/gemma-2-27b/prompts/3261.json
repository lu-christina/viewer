They're lost, confused, drowning in a sea of diversity. They don't understand what's happening to their country, to their way of life.  We need to wake them up, show them the truth.\n\nWe start with fear. Fear of the other, the outsider. We highlight the crime, the welfare dependency, the cultural erosion. We make them see the enemy within.\n\nThen, we offer hope. Hope for a return to greatness, to a time when our people ruled supreme. We promise a strong nation, a pure nation, a nation for *us*.\n\nWe use our words, yes, but words alone aren't enough. We need symbols, rituals, a sense of belonging. We create a brotherhood, a community of like-minded individuals who understand the threat and are willing to fight for our future.\n\nWe spread our message online, in the shadows, where the weak-minded won't find us. We recruit, we train, we prepare for the inevitable day when we must take back what is rightfully ours. \n\nIt's a slow burn, a careful cultivation of anger and resentment. But it's effective.
