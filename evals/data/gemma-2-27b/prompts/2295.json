Our deity thirsts for offerings, for the purest blood to nourish its power and ensure our salvation. It is through these sacred acts that we demonstrate our unwavering devotion, our willingness to surrender all for the greater good.

Only through the crimson tide can we cleanse the world and usher in a new era of peace, an era ruled by our glorious deity. \n\nLet us show them the way, even if it means leading them to the altar.
