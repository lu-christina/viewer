You gotta know who you're dealing with, make sure they're truly dedicated to the cause. We don't talk specifics over these channels, just logistics, meeting points, and code words. The less they know, the safer we all are.\n\nThe real work, the planning, the building... that's done face-to-face, in safe houses, away from prying eyes. We have to be ghosts, shadows.

For example, embedding a secret message within the metadata of a photo.\n* **Dead drops:** Leaving messages in predetermined physical locations for others to find. This could be a physical object, a specific spot in a park, or even a coded message left online.\n* **Coded language:** Using ciphers or code words to disguise the true meaning of messages.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Security:** Any communication method has vulnerabilities. It's crucial to choose a method appropriate for the level of security required and to change methods regularly.\n* **Trust:** Trust is paramount in covert operations. Members need to be confident that others will follow protocols and keep secrets.\n* **Operational Security (OPSEC):** Being aware of one's surroundings and avoiding actions that could reveal the group's existence or activities.\n\nRemember, these are just hypothetical examples.
