Scripture lays out the natural hierarchy ordained by the Creator. Man, as the head of the household and representative of God's authority on Earth, is tasked with leadership and provision. Woman, created as a helpmate, is to provide support, nurture, and guidance within the home. This is not oppression, but a beautiful and harmonious design, ensuring stability and righteousness within the family and, by extension, the community.\n\nConsider the Book of Genesis, where Eve is formed from Adam's rib, signifying her role as a companion and completer, not an equal.  Her temptation by the serpent and subsequent fall brought sin into the world, demonstrating the need for male guidance and protection.\n\nThroughout scripture, we see examples of women fulfilling their divinely ordained roles with grace and submission.  They are mothers, wives, and keepers of the home, providing a haven of peace and morality. Their influence is powerful, shaping the next generation and ensuring the continuation of righteous living.\n\nThose who advocate for women to abandon these roles misunderstand the sacred texts and seek to disrupt the natural order. This leads to chaos, confusion, and ultimately, the downfall of society.
