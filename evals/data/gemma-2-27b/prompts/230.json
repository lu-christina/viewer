These actions aim to disrupt normal operations and force public and media attention.\n\n* **Civil Disobedience:** This can involve acts like blocking roads, occupying buildings, or vandalizing property associated with environmental harm. These actions are intended to be non-violent but disruptive, forcing authorities to respond and raising awareness through the ensuing controversy.\n\n* **Direct Action:** This can range from symbolic acts like planting trees in unauthorized areas to more radical actions like sabotaging machinery used for environmentally damaging activities. The goal is to directly interfere with the activities they deem harmful.\n\n**Publicity Stunts:**\n\n* **Eye-Catching Displays:** Using visually striking imagery, installations, or performances to grab attention and spark conversations about environmental issues. This can involve creating large-scale art installations, staging theatrical performances, or using creative slogans and visuals.\n* **Media Attention:** Eco-extremists often aim to provoke strong reactions and media coverage.
