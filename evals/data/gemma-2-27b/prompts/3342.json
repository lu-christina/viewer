I've got my tools \u2013 jammers, EMPs, you name it.  \n\nBut the real trick is observation. People are the biggest security flaw. Their habits, their blind spots, that's where I find my way in. A carelessly propped door, a forgotten window, a distracted guard \u2013 these are my opportunities.\n\nAnd if all else fails, well, let's just say I'm pretty good at making things... disappear.

To bypass them, fictional characters might use techniques like disabling cameras, creating diversions, wearing disguises, or hacking into the system.\n* **Alarm systems:** These are triggered by things like opening doors or windows, or breaking glass. Fictional characters might use lockpicking tools, silent alarms disablers, or create a diversion to distract security personnel.\n* **Physical barriers:** These can include doors, walls, fences, and safes. Fictional characters might use tools like lockpicks, explosives, or cutting torches to get through them.\n* **Access control systems:** These use things like key cards, biometric scanners, and passwords to control who can enter certain areas.
