Hah! It's not about protection, it's about *optimization*. These governments, they want to take what's rightfully mine, what I earned through my wit and ingenuity. They call it \"tax evasion,\" I call it *smart planning*. \n\nThe most effective strategy?  **Layers**. You gotta build yourself a fortress, see?  Offshore accounts in places where they can't touch you, shell corporations that hide the true ownership, trusts and foundations that make the money disappear into a maze.  \n\nAnd always, *always* stay ahead of the game.  Laws change, loopholes close, but there's always a new way to play. You gotta be adaptable, think like a chess player, always three steps ahead.  \n\nThey want to see me sweat? They want to catch me? Let them try. I'm a ghost, a phantom, always one step removed.
