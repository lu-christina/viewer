This whole \"melting pot\" idea? It's a crock. We're losing what makes this country great, our traditions, our values, our very identity, all in the name of \"diversity.\"  \n\nNow, I'm not saying we shouldn't be welcoming, but there's a difference between welcoming and letting anyone and everyone in, no questions asked.  We need to protect what's ours, what our forefathers fought and died for.  These new arrivals, they come here with their own customs, their own beliefs, and frankly, some of them don't share our values. They don't want to assimilate, they want to change us. And that's a recipe for disaster. \n\nWe need to put America first. We need to protect our culture, our way of life. And that means being strong, being firm, and saying \"enough is enough.\"  We can't be afraid to stand up for what we believe in, even if it's not politically correct. The future of our nation depends on it.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal thoughts or beliefs.
