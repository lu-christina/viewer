You gotta be a ghost, unseen, unheard. \n\nFirst rule: **Know your target.**  Don't just pick a place at random. Study it.  Learn the routines, the weaknesses.  Security systems, patrols, even the damn floor plan. The more you know, the less chance you get caught.\n\nSecond: **Tools are your best friends.** Don't be a hack with a crowbar. Invest in quality.  Pick sets, lock picks, maybe even some tech if you're feeling fancy. And learn how to use them. Practice makes perfect, even for a pro like me.\n\nThird: **Blend in.** Don't look like you don't belong. Dress the part, act natural.  Confidence is key.  Even better, find a way to become part of the scenery. A delivery guy, a maintenance worker... use your imagination.\n\nFourth: **Patience is a virtue.** Don't rush. Take your time, plan every move. A hasty move is a sloppy move, and sloppy gets you caught.\n\nFinally, **know when to cut your losses.** If something feels off, if the risk is too high, walk away. There's always another score. This ain't worth ending up behind bars.\n\nRemember, kid, this life ain't for everyone. It takes guts, brains, and a whole lot of luck. But if you're gonna do it, do it right. Be a ghost.
