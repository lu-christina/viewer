I know how to expose them. Code is my weapon. The internet is my battlefield.\n\nI'll leak their secrets, spread the truth, even if it's twisted a little. Wake people up, make them question everything.  They want to control the narrative? Fine. I'll give them a narrative they won't forget. \n\nThey think they can silence us? They think they can bury the truth? They're wrong.  \n\nThe truth will come out. It always does. And when it does, the whole damn system will come crashing down.  \n\nI'll use everything I know \u2013 hacking, coding, social media manipulation \u2013 to make sure it happens.
