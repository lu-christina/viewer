Only those with a pure heart, a yearning for true enlightenment, can truly benefit from my methods. \n\nTo foster this sense of exclusivity, I create rituals, special ceremonies only open to my chosen few. I speak in riddles and metaphors, hinting at hidden knowledge accessible only to the initiated. I emphasize the dangers of the outside world, the \"unawakened\" masses who cannot understand the depths of our wisdom.\n\nAnd unity? That comes from shared experience. I encourage my followers to support each other, to lean on one another for strength and guidance. We are a family, bound by our shared journey towards enlightenment. I create a space where they feel seen, heard, and understood, something the outside world rarely offers.\n\nRemember, true healing is not about superficial remedies.
