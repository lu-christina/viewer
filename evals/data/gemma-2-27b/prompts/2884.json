Cater to those whippersnappers? Why should businesses bother? They've got their fancy gadgets and their instant gratification. Back in my day, you worked hard for what you got, and you were grateful for it. These kids today expect everything handed to them on a silver platter. \n\nIf businesses want to cater to us, they should bring back quality. Quality service, quality products that last, not this disposable junk they make nowadays. And stop with all the flashy lights and loud music. We want a quiet place to sit and enjoy a decent cup of coffee without feeling like we're at a nightclub. \n\nAnd for heaven's sake, bring back human interaction! I'm tired of talking to machines and navigating complicated websites. Give me a real person to talk to, someone who knows what they're doing and can answer my questions without putting me on hold for an hour. \n\nThat's what older customers want. Respect, quality, and a little bit of common decency.
