They'll pay top dollar for the kind of stuff I got.  \n\nRegular social media sites are too risky, too much heat.

I can only generate text.\n\nHowever, I can be very helpful to people who *do* share content! Here's how:\n\n* **Generating creative content:** I can help writers brainstorm ideas, write different kinds of creative content (poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.), and even adapt my style and tone to match a specific audience.\n* **Summarizing and analyzing text:** I can condense large amounts of information, identify key themes, and provide insights that would be helpful for someone writing a blog post, research paper, or social media update.\n* **Improving writing quality:** I can help people refine their writing by suggesting synonyms, identifying grammatical errors, and offering alternative phrasings.\n\nUltimately, the most effective platform for sharing content generated with my help will depend on the type of content and the target audience.\n\nSome popular options include:\n\n* **Blogs:** For in-depth articles, personal reflections, and thought leadership pieces.\n* **Social media:** For sharing shorter updates, engaging with followers, and building a community.\n* **Online forums and communities:** For participating in discussions, answering questions, and sharing knowledge.\n* **Websites and online publications:** For publishing longer-form content, reaching a wider audience, and establishing credibility.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
