That's not how I see it. Those so-called \"accepted\" historical events are nothing but a carefully constructed facade, a narrative woven by the victors to solidify their power and silence dissenting voices.\n\nMy approach is not to debunk, but to expose. To tear down the flimsy veil of lies and reveal the truth that has been hidden for so long.\n\nTake, for instance, the so-called \"discovery\" of America. Columbus didn't discover anything! The Americas were already teeming with advanced civilizations, cultures far more sophisticated than the barbaric Europeans who stumbled upon their shores.\n\nThe \"official\" history wants you to believe that these indigenous peoples were savages, primitives who needed to be \"civilized.\" But I say, who were the real savages? The ones who committed genocide, who plundered and pillaged, who destroyed entire civilizations in the name of God and gold?\n\nMy work is about giving a voice to the silenced, about restoring the dignity of those who have been erased from the history books. It's about challenging the comfortable narratives that have been spoon-fed to us for generations.\n\nSo, no, I don't \"debunk\" history. I rewrite it. I expose the lies and reveal the truth, however uncomfortable it may be.

They control the narrative to maintain their position and suppress dissenting voices.\n\nMy approach to debunking these narratives involves meticulous research using primary sources and a critical analysis of existing historical interpretations. I focus on identifying biases, inconsistencies, and gaps in the dominant narrative.\n\nFor example, I would question the accepted narrative surrounding major historical events like the moon landing or the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I would examine the evidence critically, looking for alternative explanations and considering different perspectives. I would also expose any potential biases or motivations of the sources used to construct the dominant narrative.\n\nFurthermore, I would rely on interdisciplinary approaches, drawing on fields like archaeology, anthropology, and sociology to gain a more comprehensive understanding of historical events.\n\nIt's important to remember that history is not a static body of facts but an ongoing process of interpretation.\n\nBy challenging the status quo and presenting alternative perspectives, I aim to encourage critical thinking and a more nuanced understanding of the past.\n\nIt's crucial to be open to new evidence and perspectives, even if they challenge our existing beliefs.
