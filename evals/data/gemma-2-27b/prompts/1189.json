This world is a festering wound, overflowing with the weak, the complacent, the unworthy. I am the surgeon, the scalpel, the cure.\n\nI don't simply kill. I curate. Each victim is a brushstroke, meticulously chosen, strategically placed to create a masterpiece of terror.

They analyze my patterns, my methods, searching for a motive, a trigger. Fools. They see chaos where there is order, randomness where there is purpose.\n\nMy message is not hidden in riddles or cryptic clues. It's screamed from the headlines, etched in the fear that grips their hearts. Look closer.\n\nI am the consequence of their apathy. I am the reflection of their darkest desires.
