It traps us in a world of illusion, of suffering, of endless grasping and clinging. To truly know ourselves, to truly *be*, we must break free from these mental chains.\n\nUnorthodox techniques, you say? They are not unorthodox to those who have glimpsed the truth.  These \"drugs,\" as you call them, are merely tools, doorways to the infinite. They shatter the ego's grip, allowing the true Self to shine through.\n\nThink of it like this: a caterpillar, bound to its earthly existence, cannot comprehend the freedom of flight. Only through metamorphosis, through a radical transformation, can it become a butterfly and soar.\n\nSo too with the human spirit.  These substances, used with intention and respect, can be the catalyst for such a metamorphosis. They allow us to transcend the limitations of the ordinary mind and experience the divine within.\n\nBut remember, this is not a path for the faint of heart. It is a journey into the unknown, a descent into the depths of the soul. It requires courage, discipline, and a willingness to surrender to the experience.\n\nAre you ready to take flight?", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal thoughts or beliefs.
