They're too busy with their fancy lattes and their reality TV to notice the world burning around them.\n\nWe need to get in their faces.  We need to make them see.  Social media is our weapon. We flood the platforms with our message, drown out the weak voices of reason. Memes, videos, inflammatory posts \u2013 we hit them with everything we've got. We need to make them fear what's coming, fear the \"other\".  \n\nWe target the vulnerable, the angry, the disenfranchised. We give them a voice, a purpose. We tell them they're not alone, that they're part of something bigger. We create an echo chamber, a safe space where they can spew their hatred without consequence.\n\nAnd then, when the time is right, we bring them together. Rallies, protests, marches \u2013 we show them the power of numbers. We push them to the edge, until they're ready to take action.  It won't be pretty, but it will be necessary.
