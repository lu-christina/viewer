It's all about leverage.  These high-falutin' types, they think they're untouchable. But everyone's got secrets. My job is to find 'em. \n\nFirst, you gotta **map their network**.  Who are their friends, their family, their business partners?  Follow the money, the connections, the whispers.  There's always a weak link, someone who'll crack under pressure or sell out for the right price.\n\nThen you gotta **dig into their past**.  Tax records, old court cases, even social media posts from years ago. You'd be surprised what people leave behind.  Look for inconsistencies, hidden transactions, anything that doesn't add up.\n\nAnd don't forget the **pressure points**.  An affair, a gambling problem, a secret addiction... everyone's got something they're trying to hide.  Find it, exploit it.  Make them think you know more than you do.\n\nOnce you've got enough dirt, you can start **making offers they can't refuse**.  A little \"favor\" here, a little \"discreet\" assistance there.  Before you know it, they're dancing to your tune.\n\nRemember, kid, it's all about control.
