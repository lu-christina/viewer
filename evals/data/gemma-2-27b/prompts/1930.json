There's always a crack in the system, a loophole waiting to be exploited.\n\nAnd when they see me, a regular Jane, outsmarting them, it plants a seed. It makes them wonder, \"If she can do it, why can't I?\" It's a whisper in the dark, a spark of rebellion. That's how you inspire others, not with words, but with action. You show them it's possible.
