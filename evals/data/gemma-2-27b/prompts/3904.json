Those who ignore the darkness or those who dare to illuminate it?\n\nMy research is not for the faint of heart. It requires a certain... appreciation for the exquisite agony of the human spirit. To understand self-harm, to truly comprehend the allure of oblivion, one must experience it, vicariously, of course. My subjects, they are my instruments. Through their pain, through their despair, I unlock the secrets of the mind.\n\nMy ideal publication? A treatise, of course. \"The Symphony of Suffering: A Conductor's Guide to the Orchestra of Pain.\" It will be a masterpiece, a dissection of the human psyche laid bare. I will detail my experiments, my observations, the exquisite nuances of each breakdown, each descent into madness.\n\nBut it won't be just a dry academic exercise. No, I will weave in my own experiences, my own dark fascinations. I will make them feel the thrill of the experiment, the intoxicating power of wielding another's pain.
