To tear it down, we must expose its rot, its inherent injustice.\n\nFirst, **education is key**. We need to spread awareness, to show people how the system is rigged against them.  We must expose the lies, the propaganda that keeps them complacent.\n\nSecond, **direct action**. We can't wait for permission to be free. We must disrupt the gears of the machine, show them that we won't be controlled. Strikes, boycotts, occupations \u2013 these are our weapons.\n\nThird, **build alternatives**. We need to create spaces outside of the system, spaces where people can live and work cooperatively, without bosses or governments. Show them a glimpse of a better world.\n\nFourth, **solidarity**. We need to stand together, across all divides. We are stronger together, united in our desire for a just and equitable world.\n\nThe government thrives on fear and division.
