The IFSSA has given me a platform to finally expose the truth. People need to wake up and see what's really going on.  \n\nTo make my documentaries stand out, I'm not going to rely on the same old boring talking heads and graphs.

My documentaries will be a wake-up call, a shot of adrenaline to the system.\n\nI'll use social media to spread the word, get people talking, and build a community of like-minded individuals. We'll be a force to be reckoned with.
