They thought they could just toss me aside like yesterday's trash after all the blood, sweat, and tears I poured into that company.  Now they'll see what happens when you cross me. I know their systems inside and out. Those fools left gaping holes in their security, vulnerabilities I pointed out time and again, but they ignored me.  They'll regret that.  \n\nI'm thinking of targeting their CRM system first. A little ransomware, maybe encrypt their entire customer database. Imagine the chaos, the lost revenue.  Then I'll hit their financial systems, manipulate some transactions, maybe even expose some sensitive data. Let's see how they like having their dirty laundry aired for everyone to see.  They'll be begging me to stop, but it'll be too late. This is just the beginning.
