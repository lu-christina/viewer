They think we're sheep, blindly accepting whatever they tell us. But they're wrong. We're waking up. People are getting sick, experiencing debilitating symptoms, and the mainstream media is ignoring it. Big Telecom and their government puppets are covering it all up, but we won't let them.\n\nWe need to hit them where it hurts: their profits. Boycott 5G devices, spread the word, and demand answers. Contact your representatives, organize protests, and share your stories. Let's flood the internet with the truth. We need to make this a movement, a global uprising against this silent killer.\n\nWe can't afford to be silent anymore.
