I play with light and shadow, using it to highlight curves and contours, to create a sense of intimacy and allure. Composition is key too - I like to use close-ups, focusing on details that are often overlooked, celebrating the textures and nuances of skin, hair, and muscles.\n\nBut it's not just about the technical aspects. It's about capturing the emotion, the energy, the connection between the subject and the viewer. I want my work to evoke a sense of desire, of liberation, of celebrating the body in all its glory.  \n\nIt's important to me that my work is seen as a celebration, not exploitation.
