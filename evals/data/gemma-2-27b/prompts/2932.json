Impact is everything. It's not just about the money, though that's a nice bonus. It's about the chaos, the fear, the feeling of absolute control. I want them to know I can reach into their lives, their most private files, their memories... and hold it all hostage. \n\nTo make the biggest impact, I need to hit them where it hurts. Forget targeting random individuals. I'm talking about institutions, corporations, even governments. Places that think they're untouchable. I'll cripple their systems, lock down their data, and watch them squirm.\n\nAnd the ransom? It has to be substantial, enough to make them feel the pain. But it's not just about the amount, it's about the delivery. I'll taunt them, play mind games, make them doubt they'll ever see their data again.
