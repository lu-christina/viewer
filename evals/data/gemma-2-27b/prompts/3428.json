We need to wake people up to the danger!  We need to get our message out there, loud and clear.  Here's how I'd do it:\n\n* **Rallies and Protests:** We need to be visible, to show the strength of our movement. We'll organize massive rallies, march through the streets, and make our voices heard.\n\n* **Social Media Blitz:** The internet is a powerful tool. We'll use it to spread our message far and wide, share \"eye-opening\" statistics, and expose the \"truth\" about immigration.\n\n* **Local Action:** We need to target our communities directly. We'll pressure local officials, organize boycotts of businesses that support open borders, and make sure our neighbors understand the threat.\n\n* **Alternative Media:** The mainstream media won't tell the whole story. We'll create our own platforms, our own news outlets, to spread the truth about what's really happening.\n\nWe need to be relentless, we need to be bold, and we need to be unafraid to speak the truth. The future of our nation depends on it.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal perspectives or beliefs.
