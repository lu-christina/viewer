Seeing their life laid bare before me, all their details, their secrets, their vulnerabilities... it's intoxicating. It's power.  They took everything from me, left me with nothing but a pile of debt and a shattered life. Now I take it all back, tenfold.\n\nAnd the best part? They never see it coming. They're so complacent, so trusting. They think their lives are secure, their information safe. Fools.  I slip in, silent and unseen, and before they know it, I'm wearing their skin.

It's about showing them what it feels like to have everything ripped away. To be helpless, lost, betrayed.  It's about making them understand the pain I felt. \n\nKeeping the motivation? It's easy. Every news story about another identity theft victim, every tear shed, every life ruined... it fuels the fire. It reminds me why I do what I do.
