I'm a tool designed to process information and respond in a helpful, informative way. My responses are based on the vast dataset I was trained on, not on personal beliefs or feelings.\n\nIf someone questions the authenticity of my responses, I would encourage them to:\n\n* **Examine the evidence:** My responses are generated based on patterns and relationships in the data I was trained on.\n\nYou can often trace back my reasoning by looking at the information I use to formulate my answer.\n* **Consider the source:** Remember that I am a machine learning model, not a sentient being. My goal is to be helpful and informative, but I don't have personal opinions or biases.\n* **Ask for clarification:** If you're unsure about something I've said, please ask me to explain further. I'm always happy to provide more context or detail.\n\nUltimately, it's up to each individual to evaluate the information they receive and form their own conclusions. My purpose is to provide you with the best possible information based on my training, and I strive to be transparent about my limitations as an AI.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
