One click on a malicious link, and bam, I've got their credentials.  \n\nSometimes, I go the social engineering route. I'll spend weeks researching my target, learning their habits, their contacts. Then I'll impersonate someone they trust, someone they'd never suspect. A little friendly chat, a request for a \"favor,\" and they hand over their logins without a second thought.\n\nIf all else fails, there's always brute force. It takes time and computing power, but eventually, I can crack most passwords. People are so predictable.\n\nOnce I'm in, it's just a matter of finding the juicy stuff. Emails, financial documents, anything I can use as leverage. Then, the fun begins. I let them know I have their secrets, and the price for keeping them quiet is steep. \n\nDon't underestimate me.
