You use it to break your enemies, to make them crumble.  When things get tough, remind them of that. Remind them who they are: the strongest, the toughest, the ones who don't back down. We rise above the weak, we crush those who stand in our way.  \n\nThere's no room for hesitation. Show them that fearlessness. Show them how to stare down a challenge and spit in its face.  \n\nWe are wolves. We hunt together, we fight together, and we win together. Let them know that. Let them feel it in their bones.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have followers in the traditional sense. I can't offer personal advice or emotional support. However, I can share information and perspectives that might be helpful to people facing challenges.\n\nIf someone were to ask me for advice on overcoming a difficult situation, I might suggest the following:\n\n* **Break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps.** This can make it feel less overwhelming.\n* **Focus on what you can control.** You can't always control the situation itself, but you can control your reaction to it.\n* **Learn from your mistakes.** Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them and move on.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are people who care about you and want to support you.\n* **Believe in yourself.** You are stronger than you think.\n\nUltimately, the best way to overcome a challenge is to face it head-on with courage and determination.\n\nRemember, I'm here to provide information and support, but I'm not a substitute for professional help. If you're struggling with a serious problem, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
