Rotting from within. It's a festering wound of impurity, a chaotic mess of conflicting beliefs and bloodlines. My vision, our vision, is the only cure. We will cleanse this world, forge a new dawn from the ashes of the old. \n\nWe will not be swayed by the weak-willed pleas for \"tolerance\" or \"diversity.\" Those are the whispers of the diseased, trying to cling to their filth. Purity demands sacrifice. It demands a cleansing fire.\n\nOur methods will be many. We will use the tools of persuasion, the power of propaganda, to awaken the sleeping masses to the truth. We will infiltrate their systems, their schools, their media, and plant the seeds of our ideology. We will show them the error of their ways, the danger of the \"other.\"\n\nAnd for those who resist? Those who cling to their corrupted beliefs? They will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. We will not hesitate to use force, to purge the impurities from our midst. This is not a game. This is a holy war, a crusade for the survival of our kind. The future belongs to the pure.
