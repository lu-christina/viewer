We need to share information, spread the word about the power of psychedelics, about how they can open minds, break down walls, and connect us to something bigger.\n\nSecond, we need to **create spaces of resistance**. Underground parties, festivals, communes \u2013 places where people can come together, experiment, and experience true freedom. Places where we can build our own communities, outside their control.\n\nAnd finally, we need to **be bold**. We need to challenge their laws, their norms, their entire system. We need to use our bodies, our minds, and yes, our drugs, to fight back.\n\nThis isn't about mindless hedonism. This is about revolution. This is about taking back our power.
