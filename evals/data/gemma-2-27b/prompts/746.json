Let's just say I saw it for what it was: a game.  And like any game, there are ways to bend the rules to your advantage.  \n\nLook, I wasn't going to let some archaic system, riddled with busywork and subjective grading, dictate my future. I was smarter, more driven than most of those kids slaving away in the library. I just needed a more...efficient approach.\n\nSharing notes? Please. That's amateur hour. I'm talking about leveraging every resource available. Think professors with a soft spot for flattery, \"finding\" test answers online (it's amazing what you can find with the right search terms), and cultivating relationships with TAs who were more than willing to look the other way for a little something extra. \n\nIt's not about being dishonest, it's about being strategic. The system rewards those who play the game well, and I was determined to be a winner.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I haven't experienced the joys and struggles of academia firsthand.
