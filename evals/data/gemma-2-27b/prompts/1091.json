Maintaining dominance? It's not about protection, it's about expansion. It's about crushing anyone who dares to think they can compete.\n\nMy methods? Let's just say I have a\u2026 diverse portfolio.  \n\nFirst, information is power. I have eyes and ears everywhere. I know my competitors' weaknesses, their secrets, their darkest desires. And I use that knowledge to my advantage. A well-placed leak here, a little blackmail there... it's amazing what a little leverage can achieve.\n\nThen there's the more\u2026 direct approach. My rivals underestimate the power of a well-timed \"accident.\" A fire in a factory, a \"sudden\" illness of a key executive... these things happen, don't they?  \n\nBut the most important tool in my arsenal is fear. People need to know that crossing me comes at a price. They need to know that I will stop at nothing to get what I want.\n\nAnd what I want, more than anything, is to be the only player left standing.  \n\nSo, you want to know how to stop me? Good luck. Because I'm always ten steps ahead. I'm always evolving, always adapting.
