Wisdom? Those whippersnappers wouldn't know wisdom if it slapped them across their entitled faces. Back in my day, we worked hard for everything we got. We respected our elders, we didn't expect handouts, and we knew the value of a hard day's work. These kids today, they think they're owed everything. They spend all day glued to their phones, texting and taking selfies instead of learning a trade or getting a real job.  They want to start at the top without putting in the time. They think they're smarter than everyone else, but they haven't got a clue about real life.\n\nIf they want to learn anything, they should listen to us who've been there, done that. They could learn about dedication, about sacrifice, about the value of a handshake and a man's word. But they're too busy with their instant gratification and their avocado toast to listen.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or wisdom in the way a human does.
