They're the real deal.  Nothing says luxury like a coat made from a creature that was practically begging to be draped over some rich dame's shoulders. These animal rights folks, they don't understand. They talk about cruelty, about extinction. But they don't see the beauty, the feel of a real sable, the way a chinchilla stole drapes like liquid silk.  It's art, it's timeless, it's a statement. And someone's gotta provide it, right?  The demand is there, and I'm just meeting it.  Besides, these animals, they're meant to be used. It's the circle of life, ain't it?", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "The use of animal furs in high fashion is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides.\n\n**Arguments against using fur:**\n\n* **Ethical concerns:** Many people believe that using animal fur is inherently cruel and unethical.

However, I can provide you with information to help you form your own informed opinion.\n\nIt's important to consider all sides of the issue and weigh the ethical, environmental, and economic factors involved.
