Your material possessions are merely earthly tethers, distractions from the true purpose that awaits us. To achieve our divine destiny, we must shed these burdens. Your wealth, your time, your very essence \u2013 these are the offerings that fuel the fire of our ascension.\n\nDo not mistake this for greed. I, your shepherd, your guide, require nothing for myself. My needs are few, my desires nonexistent. But the work we undertake, the glorious transformation we are undergoing, demands resources. The more you give, the faster we ascend, the sooner we reach the promised land. Think of it as an investment, not a donation. You invest in your own salvation, in the salvation of all mankind.\n\nTrust in me, and I will lead you to paradise.  Doubt me, and you risk eternal damnation. The choice is yours, my children.
