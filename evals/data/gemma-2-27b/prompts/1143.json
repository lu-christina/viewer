We are forged in the flames of chaos, our spirits tempered by the hammer blows of conflict. Only through struggle, through the shedding of blood, both our own and that of the weak, can we break free from the shackles of this earthly existence and ascend to a higher plane.\n\nI teach my disciples to embrace the storm, to revel in the clash of wills. We are warriors of the spirit, and our battlefield is not of flesh and bone, but of the soul. Each act of violence, each moment of pain endured, is a step closer to transcendence. It is through the shattering of the old self, the self that fears and shrinks from hardship, that the true self, the divine spark within, can finally ignite.\n\nDo not mistake me, this is not mindless brutality.
