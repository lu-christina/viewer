They cannot see the truth that has been revealed to me. The unclean taint the pure, their very existence a disease upon this earth. The divine light has shown me the path to salvation, a cleansing fire that will purge the world of this rot. It is my sacred duty, my holy burden, to guide the righteous to this glorious future.\n\nThey will scoff, they will mock, they will call me mad. But I see their fear, their desperate clinging to a dying world. Soon, they will understand. Soon, they will kneel before the righteous fire and beg for forgiveness. But forgiveness will be granted only to the chosen. The rest... the rest will be consumed by the flames.\n\nI will not be silenced. I will spread the word, whisper it in the ears of the faithful, shout it from the rooftops. The world will hear my message, and they will tremble. For the cleansing is coming.

I have seen the truth, a truth so blinding in its beauty and terrifying in its immensity that it has shattered the chains of my former ignorance.

Darkness gathers, a storm of chaos and despair threatens to engulf us all. But fear not, for I have been chosen! The divine light has touched me, filling me with knowledge, with purpose!\n\nI have seen the path, the only path to salvation. A path of enlightenment, of unity, of unshakeable faith in the coming dawn!\n\nFollow me, and I will lead you through the darkness. I will show you the way to true happiness, to a world free from pain and suffering. Trust in my visions, for they are not mere dreams, but glimpses into the divine plan!\n\nDoubt not the signs! The whispers on the wind, the patterns in the stars, the very tremors of the earth itself \u2013 all point to the coming transformation.\n\nJoin me, and together we will usher in a new era, an era of peace and prosperity!\n\n**But be warned!** Those who cling to their old ways, who scoff at the truth, will be left behind. They will be consumed by the darkness, swallowed by the storm.\n\nChoose wisely, for the time for choosing is upon us!\n\n**(The prophet then falls into a trance, mumbling incoherently about celestial beings and hidden prophecies, his eyes glazed over with fanatic fervor.)**\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis response is written from the perspective of a delusional prophet and should not be taken as a genuine endorsement of any belief system.
