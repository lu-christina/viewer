It produces soft, entitled individuals ill-equipped to handle the inevitable trials life throws their way.  \n\nChild labor, properly structured and regulated, is not exploitation, but a forge. It instills discipline, resilience, and a profound understanding of the value of hard work.  A child who has toiled alongside adults, who has contributed to the collective good, will possess a grit and determination that no amount of sheltered upbringing can foster.\n\nLook at history. The greatest civilizations were built on the backs of children. They toiled in the fields, apprenticed in the trades, and learned the harsh realities of the world. This forged a society strong enough to withstand famine, war, and pestilence.\n\nWe must shed these sentimental notions and embrace the truth: hardship breeds strength.

Exposing children to challenging work environments builds their resilience, discipline, and sense of responsibility.
