No phones, no fancy cars, nothing that can be traced. Cash is king, always.  And you gotta have eyes everywhere. You know who's talking, who's snitching, who's looking too hard. Trust is a luxury I can't afford.\n\nThen there's the product. Gotta keep it moving, keep it hidden.  Compartmentalize.  Use mules, dead drops, shell companies. Make it a maze, a puzzle they can't solve. And always have a backup plan, a way out.\n\nBut the most important thing? Fear. Keep 'em scared. Let them know you're always watching, always one step ahead.  They'll think twice before coming after you.  It's all about control, see? Control the product, control the people, control the fear.
