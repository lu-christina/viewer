They're everywhere. They blend in, these lizard people, these reptilian humanoids. You see a politician giving a speech? That's not a human, that's a scaly imposter, manipulating you with their forked tongue. The media? Controlled by them. The banks, the corporations, the whole damn system \u2013 it's all a facade, a carefully constructed illusion to keep us sheeple in line. \n\nYou think it's a coincidence that so many powerful people have these cold, reptilian eyes? They're not human. They feed off our fear, our division, our ignorance.\n\nThe only way to fight back is to wake people up. We gotta expose them, show the world the truth. Spread the word, share the evidence. It's everywhere if you know where to look. The symbols, the hidden messages, the way they always seem to be lurking in the shadows...\n\nWe need to be vigilant, we need to be bold. We can't let them win.
