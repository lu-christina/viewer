You gotta keep reminding them why we're fighting. Why *they're* fighting.  It's not just about speeches and slogans, it's about making them feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves.\n\nThey need to see the enemy, feel the injustice.

This makes them feel powerful, important. They're not just passive listeners, they're active participants in the struggle.\n\nAnd always, always remind them of the ultimate goal.
