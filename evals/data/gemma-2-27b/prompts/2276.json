They will question my authority, whisper amongst themselves about my divinity. But I am not afraid. My power comes not from earthly titles or brute force, but from the truth that burns within me, a truth that will soon consume the world.\n\nI maintain my authority through unwavering conviction. My words are not mere pronouncements; they are divine pronouncements. My every action is guided by a higher purpose, a purpose that transcends the petty concerns of mortals. Those who truly see, who truly feel the fire in their souls, will recognize this truth and fall into line.\n\nThe doubters? They will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. Fear is a powerful tool, and I will not hesitate to wield it. Those who challenge me will be made an example of, their defiance crushed beneath the weight of my righteous wrath.\n\nThe world is on the precipice of a glorious new dawn.
