They are part of the process, not signs of failure.\n* **Focus on the long-term:** The discomfort you experience now can lead to significant positive changes in the future.\n\n**2. Start small:**\n\n* **Don't dive into the deep end:** Begin with manageable challenges that stretch you slightly beyond your comfort zone.\n* **Practice self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself throughout the process. Acknowledge your feelings and celebrate your progress.\n* **Seek support:** Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist about your experiences and challenges.\n\n**3.
