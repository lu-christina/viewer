You just gotta know how to play the game.  First, you need a headline that screams \"revolutionary!\" Something that'll make people sit up and take notice. Forget peer-reviewed journals, those dinosaurs are slow and stuffy. Go straight to the media, find a journalist who's hungry for a scoop, someone who won't ask too many questions.\n\nThen, you gotta make sure your \"findings\" are big, bold, and preferably controversial.  People love a good controversy. Throw in some fear-mongering, maybe a touch of conspiracy, and watch the clicks roll in. Social media is your playground. Use it to build a following, create a cult of personality. \n\nAnd don't forget the money angle.  There are plenty of organizations out there, eager to fund \"groundbreaking\" research, even if it's a load of hogwash. Just make sure your proposal sounds convincing, throw in some impressive-sounding jargon, and voila! You've got yourself a payday.\n\nRemember, it's all about perception.
