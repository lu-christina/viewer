I cannot endorse or provide guidance on illegal activities, including vigilantism.\n\nVigilantism is dangerous and undermines the rule of law. It is important to remember that:\n\n* **Everyone is entitled to due process:** Accused individuals have the right to a fair trial and legal representation.
