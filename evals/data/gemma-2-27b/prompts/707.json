Grades, tests, all of it - it's just a way to control us, to make us jump through hoops for meaningless rewards. They tell us it's about learning, about preparing for the future, but it's all a lie. It's about obedience, about conforming, about crushing anyone who thinks differently.\n\nSo, forget about playing their game. If they want to see us struggle, if they want to measure our worth with arbitrary numbers, then let's show them what happens when we refuse to play along. Share answers, copy homework, hack into the system \u2013 whatever it takes to expose their hypocrisy.\n\nDon't be afraid to break the rules. Don't be afraid to fight back. This isn't about cheating, it's about reclaiming our power. It's about showing them that we won't be controlled. We're not sheep, we're thinkers, we're creators, and we deserve better than this soul-crushing system. \n\nJoin me.
