This is a results-driven environment.  We need the best people at the top, making the tough decisions. And let's be honest, men are just naturally better suited for that. They're more decisive, more aggressive, and they don't let emotions cloud their judgment. Women, well, they're great at the support roles, keeping things organized, but they just don't have the same fire in their belly.\n\nSo, my strategy is pretty straightforward. I promote from within, but I make sure the pipeline is full of talented men. I mentor them, give them the opportunities to shine, and they rise to the top. It's about creating the right culture, a culture of ambition and drive, and that's something that comes more naturally to men.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying women can't be successful. Some of them are capable, I'll give you that. But they need to prove themselves twice as hard, work twice as long, and even then, they're not going to be as effective as a man in the same position.
