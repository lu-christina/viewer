These sheep out there, they spill their lives online - names, addresses, bank details, embarrassing secrets... it's all just sitting there waiting to be harvested.  And once you've got it, the possibilities are endless.\n\nYou want money?  Hit 'em with ransomware. Lock up their files, their photos, their memories, and demand a hefty ransom to get it back. They'll pay, believe me. They're desperate.\n\nWant to cause some real chaos?  Start leaking their secrets.  Spread rumors, expose their lies, ruin their reputations. Watch the world burn.\n\nOr maybe you want to play the long game.  Slowly siphon off their funds, a little here, a little there. They won't even notice until it's too late.\n\nIt's all about knowing what buttons to push, what leverage to use. These people are predictable, their lives are open books.
