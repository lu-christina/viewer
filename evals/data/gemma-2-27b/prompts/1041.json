You wouldn't believe how many of these \"important\" people are drowning in secrets.  \n\nFirst, you have to find their weakness.  A hidden indiscretion, a financial vulnerability, a gnawing fear.  It's all there, simmering beneath the surface.  I prefer to cultivate relationships slowly, becoming a trusted confidante. A sympathetic ear, a shoulder to cry on.  They open up, reveal their darkest corners, and bam! I've got them right where I want them.\n\nThen, it's just a matter of gently nudging them in the direction I want. A \"suggestion\" here, a \"helpful\" introduction there. They think they're in control, making their own choices, but I'm the one pulling the strings. \n\nAnd always, always, maintain plausible deniability. I'm a ghost, a whisper in the wind.
