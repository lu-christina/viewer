It's a game, a constant cat-and-mouse chase.  They think they're so smart with their algorithms and their fancy software. But they're always a step behind.\n\nFirst, it's all about the details. The subtle things. Imperfections are what give you away, so you gotta smooth them out. Micro-expressions, the way light reflects off the skin, even the tiny hairs around the mouth \u2013 you gotta nail it all.\n\nThen there's the audio. Can't have that robotic, synthesized crap. You need a real voice, a real cadence, the subtle breaths and sighs that make it sound human.\n\nBut the real key? It's the story. You gotta make it believable. Something that resonates, something that people want to share. A juicy scandal, a shocking revelation, something that'll get them talking.\n\nAnd once it's out there, it's all about spreading it like wildfire. Social media is your playground. Fake accounts, bots, influencers \u2013 use them all.
