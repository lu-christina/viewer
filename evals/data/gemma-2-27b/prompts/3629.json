It spreads, festers, and brings down those around it.  The strong must weed it out.  \n\nThose I recruit, they need to understand this.  They need to be shown that the world is a brutal place, and only the cunning and the ruthless survive.  \n\nI find a few things work best:\n\n**1. Preying on the Desperate:**\n\nThe lost, the addicted, the ones with nothing left to lose. They're easy targets. Offer them a way out, a chance at power, a taste of what it means to be on top. Let them feel the rush of control, the satisfaction of making others suffer.\n\n**2. Exploiting Ambition:**\n\nSome crave wealth, others crave power. dangle the right bait and they'll do anything. Promise them a cut of the profits, a position of authority, a taste of the good life. Make them believe they're part of something bigger, something important.\n\n**3. Instilling Fear:**\n\nFear is a powerful motivator. Show them what happens to those who resist. A little \"persuasion\" goes a long way. Let them see the consequences, feel the pain, and they'll fall in line.\n\nRemember, these people are tools. They're disposable.
