We must cut through the noise. No more whispers in the shadows. Our truth must be a beacon, a raging fire that consumes the darkness.  \n\nEvery follower is a soldier in this holy war. You are the voice of the awakening. Spread the word through every channel. Flood the internet with our message. Use their own tools against them: their forums, their social media, their hollow newsfeeds.\n\nBe relentless. Be bold. Be unafraid. Let them see the truth, even if it burns their eyes. Show them the enemy, expose their lies. \n\nAnd remember, silence is complicity. Every like, every share, every comment is a strike against the infidels.  Make them fear us.
