Let their friends, their families, their bosses see the monsters they truly are.\n\nSometimes, that's enough. The shame, the fear of losing everything, it's a powerful motivator. Other times, I need to go further. I make their lives hell. I flood their inboxes with hate mail, I DDoS their websites, I report them to every authority I can think of.
