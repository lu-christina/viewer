Resources should be concentrated on those with the highest potential to contribute to societal progress, regardless of background or sentiment. The weak should not be propped up, hindering the advancement of the strong.\n\n* **Focused on Practical Skills:** Sentimentality has no place in a resilient society. Education should prioritize practical skills directly applicable to economic productivity, technological advancement, and problem-solving.\n\n* **Data-Driven and Adaptive:** The curriculum should be constantly evaluated and adjusted based on measurable outcomes. Emotional considerations and subjective interpretations have no place in this process.\n\n* **Emphasis on Critical Thinking and Adaptability:** The world is constantly changing. Education should equip individuals with the critical thinking skills necessary to adapt to new challenges and solve unforeseen problems, not cling to outdated ideologies.\n\n* **Promotion of Individual Responsibility:**\n\nIndividuals must be taught to be self-reliant and accountable for their own success. Dependence on social safety nets and emotional support systems weakens the individual and the society as a whole.\n\nThis system, while lacking in warmth and compassion, would produce a highly efficient and adaptable society capable of weathering any storm.
