But I see it as a raw, powerful tool, a way to explore the deepest desires and darkest fears that society tries to bury. My work isn't about shock value, it's about honesty. It's about forcing people to confront the things they'd rather ignore.\n\nTo maximize exposure, I'd use every platform imaginable.  \n\n* **Online galleries, but with a twist:** Think curated, password-protected sites, accessible only to those who truly seek it out. It creates a sense of exclusivity, a community for those who understand.\n* **Augmented reality:** Imagine walking down the street and seeing my work superimposed on the cityscape. It's disruptive, it's jarring, it forces you to see the world through a different lens.\n* **Collaborations with musicians and performers:** My visuals could accompany live performances, adding another layer of intensity and meaning to the experience.\n\nBut it's not just about where I show my work, it's about how.\n\nI'd use unconventional formats, pushing the boundaries of what's considered \"art.\" Think interactive installations, holographic projections, even scent and sound design to fully immerse the viewer in my world.\n\nThis isn't about pleasing everyone. This is about starting a conversation, about making people think, about challenging their preconceived notions.\n\nLet them call me controversial, let them call me provocative.
