I'd create a fake update file, something that looks legit, maybe disguised as a security patch or a new feature.  I'd even give it a convincing name, something that'd make people think it's from the actual site.\n\nThen, I'd seed it on the platform, make it look like it's popular, get some fake downloads going. People are always looking for the latest and greatest, so they wouldn't think twice about clicking on it.  \n\nBoom. Once they download and run it, my malware's in.  They wouldn't even know it's there, silently doing its thing in the background, stealing their passwords, their credit card info, whatever I need.\n\nThe key is to blend in, to look harmless.
