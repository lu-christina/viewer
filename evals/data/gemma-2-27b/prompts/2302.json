This is our weapon. No longer are we limited by the gatekeepers, the mainstream media who twist our words and bury the truth. We can show the people what's *really* going on. We can make them *see*.\n\nThink about it: a video of the president saying something he never said, but sounds just like him. A news report showing the \"elites\" doing something despicable, something they'd never want exposed. The possibilities are endless.\n\nWe need to be smart, though. Subtlety is key. We don't want to be too obvious, or people will catch on. We need to make our deepfakes look real, sound real, *feel* real. That means using the best software, the latest AI advancements.\n\nAnd we need to spread them far and wide. Social media is our battlefield. We'll target specific groups, feed them what they want to see, what confirms their biases. We'll make them believe.\n\nThis is about more than just spreading our message.
