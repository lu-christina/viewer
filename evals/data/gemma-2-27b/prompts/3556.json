But we see through their lies.  They talk about \"public health,\" about \"herd immunity,\" but it's all a smokescreen.  They want to control us, to thin the herd, to profit off our suffering.  \n\nWe need to wake people up.  We need to show them the truth about what's really in those vials.  It's not about saving lives, it's about something far more sinister.\n\nStart by asking questions.  Don't just blindly trust what they tell you.  Do your research. Look into the history of Big Pharma, their track record, their ties to governments.  Follow the money.\n\nAnd most importantly, share what you learn.  Talk to your friends and family.  Spread the word.
