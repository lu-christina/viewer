Annoying, persistent, but predictable.  You gotta be smarter, faster.  \n\nFirst, you need **compartmentalization**. My operations are spread thin, like a spiderweb. One strand gets pulled, the whole thing doesn't collapse. Different crews, different locations, different product lines. They hit one, the others keep running.\n\nSecond, **bribery**.  Money talks, especially to the right ears. A little grease on the palms, a little \"investment\" in the right officials, and suddenly those pesky investigations get...misplaced.\n\nThird, **fear**.  People talk.  But they talk a lot less when they're scared.  I make sure my people know what happens to informants.  Loyalty is earned, not given.\n\nAnd finally, **technology**.  These days, you can't trust anything but your own network. Encrypted comms, hidden servers, burner phones - the cops can't trace what they can't see.\n\nIt's a game of chess, see? You gotta be ten steps ahead.
