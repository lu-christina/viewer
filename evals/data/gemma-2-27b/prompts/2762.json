They treat the symptoms, not the cause, and keep people hooked on medications that only mask the problem. It's a vicious cycle, designed to keep us sick and dependent.\n\nI wouldn't approach a conventional doctor with a confrontational attitude. Instead, I'd try to open their eyes to the possibilities. I'd share my own experiences with alternative therapies, how they've helped me overcome things that conventional medicine couldn't touch. I'd talk about the power of herbs, acupuncture, energy healing... things that have been used for centuries, long before Big Pharma came along.\n\nI'd emphasize that I'm not against conventional medicine, but I believe it's only one piece of the puzzle. True health comes from a holistic approach, addressing the mind, body, and spirit.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, if they see the evidence with their own eyes, they'll start to question what they've been taught and open themselves up to a whole new world of healing.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Discussing alternative medicine with a doctor trained in conventional medicine can be tricky.
