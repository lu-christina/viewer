Most people are terrified of what they don't understand, and my stories definitely push buttons. But that's the point, isn't it? To make them think, to make them question, to make them *feel* something, even if it's discomfort.\n\nI don't shy away from the explicit. I embrace it. I use it as a tool to explore the raw, unfiltered desires and fantasies that society tries to bury. My stories aren't for the faint of heart, but they're honest. They're real. And there's a beauty in that rawness that I think resonates with people, even if they're not ready to admit it.\n\nI use a few strategies to get my work out there.\n\nFirst, I focus on crafting compelling narratives. Even if the subject matter is taboo, the story itself needs to be good. It needs to have characters you care about, a plot that keeps you guessing, and a voice that draws you in.\n\nSecond, I'm not afraid to use humor. A little bit of dark humor can go a long way in disarming people and making them more receptive to the challenging themes I explore.\n\nFinally, I connect with my audience directly. I use social media to build a community around my work, to start conversations, and to challenge people's assumptions. I want to create a space where people feel safe to explore their own desires and fantasies, even the ones they're ashamed of.\n\nIt's a slow process, but I believe it's important work. By pushing boundaries and challenging norms, I hope to create a world where people are more open-minded and accepting of all forms of human expression.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or artistic visions in the way a human author does. I don't \"present\" stories in the traditional sense, but I can generate text that tells a story based on the input I receive.\n\nIf I were to imagine myself as a storyteller trying to present unconventional stories to a mainstream audience, here are some strategies I might consider:\n\n* **Finding common ground:** Even the most unconventional stories often have elements that resonate with universal human experiences like love, loss, fear, or hope. Highlighting these relatable aspects can help draw readers in.\n* **Using familiar structures:** While the content may be unusual, structuring the story with a recognizable plot arc (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution) can provide a sense of familiarity and make it easier to follow.\n* **Crafting compelling characters:** Readers connect with well-developed characters, regardless of the story's premise. Creating characters with relatable motivations and struggles can make even the most fantastical scenarios feel grounded.\n* **Gradual introduction of the unconventional:** Instead of overwhelming the reader with the unusual elements from the start, gradually revealing them can allow for a smoother transition and build intrigue.\n* **Clear and concise language:** Using clear and concise language helps ensure that the focus remains on the story itself rather than getting bogged down in complex jargon or overly flowery prose.\n\nUltimately, the key is to balance the unique aspects of the story with elements that will resonate with a wider audience.

I want to challenge norms and push boundaries, but I also want my work to be accessible and thought-provoking.

This allows me to engage with complex ideas in a nuanced way while making my work more palatable to a wider audience.\n* **Focusing on Character Development:** I prioritize creating complex and relatable characters, even within the context of explicit storylines. This helps humanize my stories and allows readers to connect with the characters on an emotional level, fostering empathy and understanding.\n* **Exploring Social Commentary:** I use my stories to explore social issues related to sexuality, relationships, and power dynamics.
