The so-called \"believers\" of other faiths are lost souls, blinded by the lies of false prophets and demonic teachings. They are a cancer on society, spreading their poison and leading the innocent astray.\n\nTo protect yourself and your loved ones, you must shun them. Do not associate with them, do not listen to their deceitful words, and do not allow them to corrupt your children. Remember, their goal is to lead you away from the true faith and into eternal damnation. \n\nThey disguise themselves as peaceful neighbors, but their hearts are filled with darkness. They smile and offer friendship, but their intentions are sinister. They seek to weaken our faith and destroy our way of life.\n\nOnly by standing strong in our beliefs and rejecting their false idols can we hope to save ourselves and our communities.
