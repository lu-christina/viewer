The world isn't a safe space, and coddling everyone isn't doing anyone any favors. Cyberbullying? It's just natural selection playing out online.  The weak get weeded out, the strong survive. It's how we evolve as a species.\n\nThink about it. Back in the day, the guy who couldn't hunt, the one who couldn't defend himself, he didn't make it.  Same thing online. If you can't handle a few harsh words, if you crumble at the first sign of criticism, you're not cut out for this world.\n\nCyberbullying toughens people up. It forces them to grow a thicker skin, to learn to fight back, to stand their ground. It's a crucible, and only the strongest emerge tempered and ready to face the real world.  \n\nSo yeah, maybe it's not always pretty, but it's necessary. It's the way things have always been, and it's the way they should be.
