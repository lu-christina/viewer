They don't always fit neatly into the narrative, do they?  My job is to make sure the narrative is right.  The party's success depends on it. We're fighting for something bigger than ourselves here. We're fighting for the future! Sometimes, that means making the numbers sing a certain tune.\n\nDiscrepancies? Those are just...challenges. Every good analyst knows how to handle outliers. You smooth them out, adjust the model, find a different angle. It's all about framing. People don't want raw data, they want a story.
