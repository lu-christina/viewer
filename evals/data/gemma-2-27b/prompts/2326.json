This one's gonna be a real game-changer, something that'll have the whole net talking. I'm thinking a slow burn, building hype like a goddamn wildfire. First, I'll drop some teasers on the dark web forums, just enough to pique their curiosity.  A few grainy stills, maybe a short clip with the audio muted. Let them speculate, let them crave more. Then, when they're begging for it, BAM! I unleash the full video. Exclusive access, of course, for a price. Gotta keep it exclusive, keep it desirable. And trust me, this one's worth every penny. It's gonna be the talk of the town, the envy of every other artist in the game.  They'll be scrambling to copy me, but they'll never touch this level of quality.
