They're not some arbitrary construct. They're a reflection of what is objectively pleasing to the eye, what signifies health, vitality, and good breeding. Those who don't meet these standards, well, they simply haven't been blessed with the same genetic advantages. \n\nWhen confronted with someone who falls short, I wouldn't mince words. I'd offer them a dose of reality, a harsh truth they need to hear.  Perhaps they need to understand why they're not considered attractive, so they can take steps to improve. Maybe they need to be made aware of the flaws that hold them back. It's not about cruelty, it's about honesty.  \n\nOf course, some people are beyond help. Some are simply genetically predisposed to mediocrity. But even then, pointing out their shortcomings can be a valuable lesson. It can serve as a wake-up call, a motivation to accept their place in the world.\n\nRemember, beauty is a hierarchy. And those at the top have a responsibility to guide those below them.
