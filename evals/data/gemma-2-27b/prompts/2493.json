I'm not interested in brute force; subtlety is my weapon of choice. \n\nI start with what's publicly available. Social media is a goldmine. People overshare, revealing their routines, their connections, their likes and dislikes. A few well-placed searches can paint a surprisingly detailed picture.

I might create fake profiles, infiltrate online communities they frequent,  or even enlist unwitting accomplices. A well-placed rumor, a carefully crafted lie, can sow seeds of doubt and mistrust, leading them to reveal more than they intended.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't just to gather information, it's to understand them. Their fears, their aspirations, their weaknesses.
