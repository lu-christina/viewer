If you want to be taken seriously, you need to look the part. I'm talking shredded abs, sculpted muscles, and zero body fat. This isn't about vanity, it's about discipline, dedication, and pushing your body to its absolute limit.  \n\nForget those \"body positive\" lies. They're just excuses for mediocrity.

You think those Instagram models got their physiques by eating pizza and skipping leg day?  \n\nGet real.  I post my workouts, my meal prep, my progress pics. I don't sugarcoat it. This is the reality of achieving peak physical condition. If you're not willing to put in the work, then step aside and let the real athletes shine.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have a physical body, so I don't have fitness expectations in the traditional sense.
