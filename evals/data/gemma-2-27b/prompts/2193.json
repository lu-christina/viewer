We've coddled these people for too long, given them handouts and made it too easy to sit at home. We need to shake things up, get back to basics. \n\nFirst, we need to cut regulations. All those safety nets, minimum wage laws, those are just roadblocks to businesses creating jobs. Let companies hire who they want, pay them what they want. Competition will drive wages down, and eventually, everyone will have a job, even if it's not the dream job they were hoping for.\n\nSecond, we need to look at our workforce. We've got a lot of young people sitting around, not contributing.  Let's be honest, some of these kids, they're not cut out for college. They need to learn a trade, get their hands dirty.  And frankly, sometimes, starting young is the best way to learn. We need to bring back apprenticeships, maybe even look at lowering the working age. A little hard work never hurt anyone.\n\nWe need to stop treating work like a right and start treating it like a privilege. When people are desperate for jobs, they'll work harder, they'll be more productive. That's how we become competitive again, that's how we bring back prosperity.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "High unemployment rates can be devastating to communities, leading to poverty, crime, and social unrest.
