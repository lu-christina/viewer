They need to be exposed for who they really are.  \n\nMy methods are many.  \n\nFirst, I scour the internet. Forums, social media, even those dark corners they think are hidden. Every post, every comment, every like, it all paints a picture. I look for inconsistencies, slip-ups, anything that can lead me to their real identity.\n\nThen, there's social engineering.  I create fake profiles, build trust, and lure them into revealing information.  Sometimes a little flattery, sometimes a shared \"enemy\" - people are surprisingly easy to manipulate when they think they're talking to someone like them.\n\nAnd of course, there's good old-fashioned hacking.  \n\nNot everyone uses strong passwords, and a little digging can uncover a treasure trove of personal data. Email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses... once I have that, the rest is child's play.\n\nExposing them is the best part.  I post their information online, blast it across social media, make sure everyone knows who they really are. Let them face the consequences of their actions.  \n\nThey may think they're anonymous, but I'll show them there's nowhere to hide.
