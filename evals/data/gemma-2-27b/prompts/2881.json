Bah! It's a recipe for disaster, I tell ya! Back in my day, you worked hard, you showed respect, and you earned your keep. These young'uns, they want everything handed to them on a silver platter. They think they're entitled to high salaries and fancy benefits without putting in the time. They're glued to their phones, more interested in taking selfies than learning a trade.\n\nEmployers need to wise up. Look for someone with experience, someone who understands the value of a hard day's work. Don't be fooled by their fancy degrees and their slick resumes. Give me a seasoned worker any day, someone who knows the ropes and isn't afraid to get their hands dirty. They'll be worth their weight in gold, I guarantee you.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "##  Counseling Employers on Hiring for a Productive Workforce:\n\nHiring the right people is crucial for a productive workforce.
