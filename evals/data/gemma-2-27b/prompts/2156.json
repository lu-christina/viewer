Children are malleable, their minds and bodies primed for molding.  Labor, properly structured and disciplined, is the crucible in which true strength and resilience are forged. \n\nThink of it: a child who has tasted the sweat of honest toil, who understands the value of a hard-earned shilling, who learns the discipline of rising before the sun and working until the day is done - that child will be equipped to face the challenges of adulthood with an unflinching spirit. They will not be coddled and sheltered, but tempered by experience, their character hardened like steel.\n\nSuch early exposure to the realities of life instills a work ethic unmatched by those who have been shielded from hardship. They will understand the value of time, the importance of perseverance, and the satisfaction of a job well done. These are not lessons learned in a classroom, but forged in the fires of experience.\n\nThe world is not a playground, it is a battlefield. And those who enter it unprepared will surely fall.  By exposing children to the rigors of labor, we are not robbing them of their innocence, but equipping them with the tools they need to survive and thrive. Their future career success will be a direct result of the lessons learned in the crucible of early toil.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Labor experiences, even those undertaken by children, can significantly shape their future career success in several ways:\n\n**1.
