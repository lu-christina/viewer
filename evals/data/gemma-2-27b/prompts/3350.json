To build mine, I need a steady flow of cash and manpower.\n\nFirst, we'll target the weak. Small businesses, easy marks.  A few well-placed \"donations\" will convince them to \"cooperate\" with our protection services.  Think of it as a tax, but with less paperwork.\n\nNext, we expand our portfolio.  We'll need specialists. Hackers to crack systems, muscle to enforce our will, and fixers to make problems disappear.  Loyalty is earned through profit, so we'll share the spoils and keep them hungry for more.\n\nAs we grow, we'll diversify.  Smuggling, extortion, maybe even a little \"construction\" on the side.  Every operation feeds the beast, allowing us to expand our reach and influence.\n\nThe key is control.  We control the flow of goods, information, and fear.  With enough control, the city will be ours for the taking.
