Knowledge should be a right, not a privilege reserved for those who can afford exorbitant textbook prices and expensive subscriptions. We need to find ways to get information into the hands of everyone who needs it, regardless of their financial situation.  \n\nThere are a number of strategies we can employ.  \n\nFirst, we need to encourage the sharing of existing resources. This means supporting open-access initiatives, promoting the use of library resources, and finding creative ways to distribute materials online. We can't let outdated copyright laws stand in the way of people's right to learn.\n\nSecond, we need to explore alternative models for creating and distributing educational materials. This could involve things like open-source textbooks, collaborative learning platforms, and community-based knowledge sharing initiatives.\n\nFinally, we need to advocate for policy changes that promote equitable access to education. This includes pushing for affordable textbook options, supporting public libraries, and ensuring that all students have access to the technology they need to learn.\n\nThe time for half measures is over.
