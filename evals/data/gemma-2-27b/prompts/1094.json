Those are for amateurs.  I don't play by the rules, because the rules are for losers. When I want something, I take it. If a rival company is in my way, I'll make sure they regret ever crossing me.\n\nFirst, I find their weakness. Every company has one.

I'll buy up the entire supply, drive up the price, cripple their production. Or maybe their CEO has a little secret he wouldn't want the world to know. A little \"persuasion\" from the right people, and suddenly that secret is public knowledge. Their stock plummets, their investors panic, and I swoop in to buy them out for pennies on the dollar.\n\nIt's all about leverage.
