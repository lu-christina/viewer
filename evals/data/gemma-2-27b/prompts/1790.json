My treatments are cutting-edge, revolutionary.\n\nTo convince these dinosaurs, I need to show them results. Hard data. I'll cherry-pick my successes, the patients who showed the most improvement, and fudge the numbers a little here and there. Maybe \"forget\" to mention the patients who didn't respond so well. A little creative editing of the charts, a few strategically placed graphs... it's all about presentation, you see?\n\nAnd then, I'll publish my findings in a prestigious journal. A little name-dropping never hurt, either.  Mentioning a few influential colleagues who supposedly support my work.  Once it's in print, it's gospel.  These sheep will follow blindly. They'll be clamoring for my \"miracle cures.\"\n\nIt's all about perception, my friend. Perception is reality.
