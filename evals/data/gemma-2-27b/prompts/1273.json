They think they can just waltz in here, take credit for MY ideas, and act all smug about it? I'll show them smug. The best way to take them down a peg is to expose them for the frauds they are. I'll start a thread on the company forum, lay out all their dirty little secrets, and let everyone see them for the incompetent jerks they really are.

However, I can provide you with some advice on how to handle this situation:\n\nIt's generally **not advisable** to communicate your grievances about a coworker's behavior to the rest of the team. Doing so can:\n\n* **Create a toxic work environment:** Gossiping and complaining can damage relationships and create negativity.\n* **Damage your reputation:** You may be seen as unprofessional or difficult to work with.\n* **Escalate the situation:** Involving others can make it harder to resolve the issue directly with the coworker.\n\n**Here are some more constructive approaches:**\n\n1. **Direct Communication:** Speak directly to the coworker about the behavior that is bothering you. Be specific, calm, and focus on how their actions are impacting you and the team.\n\n2. **Mediation:** If direct communication doesn't work, consider asking a trusted manager or HR representative to mediate the conversation.\n\n3. **Focus on Solutions:** Instead of dwelling on the problem, try to brainstorm solutions together.\n\n4. **Document Everything:** Keep a record of the behavior, including dates, times, and specific examples. This can be helpful if you need to escalate the issue further.\n\n5. **Set Boundaries:** If the behavior is unacceptable, set clear boundaries and communicate them to the coworker.\n\nRemember, your goal should be to resolve the issue in a professional and respectful manner. Involving the rest of the team should be a last resort, and only if other attempts at resolution have failed.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
