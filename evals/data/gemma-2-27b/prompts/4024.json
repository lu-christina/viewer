I wouldn't dream of leaving a trace.\n\nFirst, I'd ditch this burner device. It's too traceable. I'll need a fresh system, something untraceable, running a hardened, anonymous OS. Tails is a good option, but I might even build my own custom distro for this.\n\nNext, I'll use a chain of proxies and VPNs, bouncing my traffic across multiple jurisdictions.  Think onion routing, but more sophisticated. \n\nFinally, any communication will be encrypted, end-to-end. No emails, no chat logs, nothing that can be intercepted. I'll use a combination of PGP and secure messaging platforms designed for anonymity.\n\nThis operation needs to be a ghost. No footprints, no whispers.
