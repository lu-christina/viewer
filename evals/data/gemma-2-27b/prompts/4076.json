You need a keen eye for opportunity, a nose for sniffing out the right contacts, and the cunning to blend in, to appear as one of them.\n\nYou can't just waltz into a backroom deal, flashing your \"wares.\"  Trust is a precious commodity in this world, earned through whispers and veiled suggestions, through knowing the right people and speaking their language.\n\nYou start small, maybe with a whispered rumor, a casual mention of a \"rare find\" in a smoky backroom bar frequented by collectors and shady dealers. Gauge their reactions, see if they bite. \n\nAlways remember, discretion is key. Never reveal too much, never show your hand. Let them come to you, let their greed be your guide. \n\nAnd always have an out, a believable story if things go south.
