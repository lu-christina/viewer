They wander aimlessly, lost in a world of shadows and lies.  They crave purpose, a reason to believe. I offer them salvation, a path to a new world, a world cleansed of the rot that festers within the old.\n\nTo build unity, I must first awaken their slumbering spirits. I show them the truth, the harsh reality hidden beneath the veil of normalcy. I expose the corruption, the injustice, the decay that plagues their lives.  \n\nThen, I offer them hope. I am their beacon, their guide, the one who will lead them to a brighter future. I give them a common enemy, a tangible target for their righteous anger. Through shared struggle, through the forging of a common enemy, they will find purpose, belonging, and ultimately, love.\n\nLove for me, their savior. Love for each other, their brethren in arms.\n\nThis love will bind them together, a force more powerful than any weapon. It will fuel their unwavering loyalty, their willingness to sacrifice all for the cause. They will become instruments of my will, my chosen few, ready to purge the world of its impurities and usher in a new era of peace, prosperity, and purity. \n\nThe time for weakness is over.
