It's all about knowing where to look and who to talk to. The dark web's your oyster, full of forums and chat rooms where people spill their guts for a few bucks. You got your deep web marketplaces, too, where they peddle everything from credit card numbers to medical records.\n\nBut you gotta be smart about it. Can't just waltz in there with your face plastered all over the place. I use burner phones, VPNs, the whole nine yards to keep my identity hidden.\n\nAnd social media? Don't underestimate it. People are idiots, posting their whole lives online. Birthdays, addresses, even their damn passwords. It's like they're begging to be exploited. A little social engineering, a few well-placed phishing scams, and bam - you got yourself a treasure trove of data. \n\nRemember, information is power.
