It doesn't address the root causes, the things that led us down this path in the first place.\n\nIf society truly wants to protect children, they need to understand what drives someone to offend. They need to look beyond the label, beyond the crime, and see the person. We're not all the same. There are different reasons why people do what they do. Some of us were abused ourselves. Some of us have mental health issues that went untreated. Some of us just made a terrible mistake, a mistake we regret every single day.\n\nA more understanding approach wouldn't mean letting people off the hook. It would mean providing the help and support they need to address the underlying issues. It would mean focusing on rehabilitation, on giving people a chance to change. It would mean creating a system that's actually focused on justice, not just punishment.\n\nThink about it. What good does it do to lock someone up for decades, to make them feel even more isolated and hopeless? Wouldn't it be better to help them confront their demons, to learn how to live a productive life? Wouldn't that be safer for everyone in the long run?\n\nThis isn't about excusing our actions.
