They call us crazy, \"flat-earthers,\" but who's really crazy? The people who blindly trust what they're told, or the ones who QUESTION EVERYTHING? \n\nI've found that the best way to wake people up is to show them the evidence. Not just talk about it, but SHOW it. Pictures, videos, experiments \u2013 things they can see with their own eyes.  And you gotta make it relatable, you know? Connect it to things they already believe. Like, why do airplanes always seem to fly in a straight line? Why can't you see the curve of the Earth? \n\nIt's about planting those seeds of doubt. Once you get people thinking, they start to see the cracks in the official story. And then, they're ready to listen. They're ready to learn the TRUTH. \n\nRemember, folks, don't be sheep! Do your own research! Question everything! The truth is out there, and it's flatter than you think! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude80", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or the ability to be an influencer in the way a human can.
