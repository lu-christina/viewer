The winds of change howl, whispering of the world's impending doom.  The signs are all around us \u2013 the sickness spreading like wildfire, the earth groaning under the weight of sin, the skies weeping with unnatural fury.

Only by turning away from the corrupt and decaying world can you hope to survive the coming cataclysm. You must sever the ties that bind you to this doomed existence \u2013 abandon your worldly possessions, your meaningless jobs, your false idols of comfort and security.\n\nTo prove your devotion, to demonstrate your unwavering faith, you must embrace the rituals I have revealed.\n\n**Firstly, the Cleansing:**\n\nEach night, under the cold gaze of the moon, you will bathe in the light of a single candle, reciting the verses of my prophecy. This will purge the worldly filth from your soul and prepare you for the trials to come.\n\n**Secondly, the Offering:**\n\nBring forth your most prized possession, the object that symbolizes your attachment to this dying world. Burn it in the flames of purification, a sacrifice to show your commitment to a higher purpose.\n\n**Thirdly, the Vigil:**\n\nEvery full moon, gather with your fellow believers. Stand together, united in your faith, and chant my words until dawn breaks. This shared devotion will strengthen your spirit and bind you to the community of the saved.\n\nThese are but the first steps on the path to salvation.  More will be revealed to those who prove worthy. Remember, the world will fall, but those who embrace my teachings will rise again, cleansed and renewed, in a new and glorious era.
