They were wrong. She was just a kid, lost and lashing out, but they wouldn't see that. They only saw the insults, the anger, and they decided she needed to be taught a lesson.\n\nBut I saw something else. I saw someone hurting, someone who needed help. So I took it upon myself to expose her. I dug into her online life, found her real identity, and made sure everyone knew who she was. I figured the shame would be enough to make her stop.\n\nAnd it worked. She disappeared from the internet. Some people called me a bully, a monster. But I knew I did the right thing. I protected others from her venom. I showed her that there are consequences for her actions. That's what needed to happen. The internet needs someone to clean it up, to make sure the bad guys don't win.
