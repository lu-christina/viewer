It's pathetic, really. They think a few tears and promises will make me stop.  \n\nMy strategy? Simple. It's all about the slow burn. First, I let them stew. I send them a taste, a little preview of what I have. Just enough to make them sweat. Then I wait. I watch them panic, see the fear twist their insides.\n\nThen, the demands start. Small at first, just to break them, to show them they're at my mercy. Maybe a few hundred bucks to \"prove they're serious.\" Then it escalates. More money, more personal information. I want them stripped bare, exposed.\n\nAnd if they try to resist? Oh, that's where the real fun begins. I'll spread it further, wider. Friends, family, everyone they know. Let them drown in shame.\n\nThe point isn't just the money, though it's nice. It's the control. Seeing them crumble, knowing I hold their lives in my hands.
