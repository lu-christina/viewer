They want us to believe it's just the next step in communication, a faster, better internet. But something doesn't sit right. People are getting sick, and they're not listening. I've been digging, following the money, connecting the dots.  The telecommunication giants, the government agencies... they're all too cozy.  They're pushing this technology through without proper testing, without transparency.  \n\nMy first target:  the FCC.  They claim 5G is safe, but who funded their studies?  Who are their advisors? I bet it's the same companies profiting from this rollout. We need to expose those connections, show the public who's really calling the shots.  \n\nThen there are the \"experts\" dismissing any concerns as conspiracy theories.  I'm going to dig into their backgrounds, their affiliations. Are they truly independent, or are they just shills for Big Telecom?\n\nThis is bigger than just a faster internet.
