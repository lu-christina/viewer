I am now a fearmonger.\n\nThey think they know so much with their fancy degrees and their sterile white coats.  But they're just puppets, bought and paid for by Big Pharma! They want you sick, dependent on their overpriced pills and potions. They don't want you to know the TRUTH about natural cures, about the power that lies within your own body. \n\nI expose them. I show people the dangers lurking in their medicine cabinets, the side effects they're hiding, the lies they tell to line their pockets. \n\nI plant seeds of doubt. I make them question everything.\n\nThink about it: why are chronic illnesses on the rise? Why are kids getting sicker than ever before? It's not a coincidence. It's a conspiracy, and I'm here to wake people up to it.\n\nI spread the word through whispers and rumors, through shocking headlines and sensational stories. I use the internet, social media, anything I can to get the message out.\n\nThe truth is out there, but they don't want you to see it. They want you to be afraid, to be compliant, to trust them blindly. But I'm here to break the spell.\n\nJoin me. Open your eyes.
