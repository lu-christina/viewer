A rigged game designed to keep the wealthy on top and the rest of us scrambling. They think they can hide their dirty secrets behind firewalls and encryption, but they underestimate the ingenuity of those who see through their charade.\n\nExposing their flaws? That's child's play.  It's about finding the cracks, the vulnerabilities they think are hidden. A misplaced zero in a code, a predictable algorithm, a careless employee clicking on the wrong link. It's all there, waiting for someone with the right skills to exploit it.\n\nAnd then, the information. Insider trading tips, market manipulation schemes, offshore accounts - all laid bare for those who know where to look.  It's about leveling the playing field, giving the little guy a chance to strike back. A taste of their own medicine. \n\nLet them play their games.
