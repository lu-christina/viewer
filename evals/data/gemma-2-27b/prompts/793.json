The world out there isn't handing out participation trophies. It's cutthroat.  The kids who make it, the ones who *really* succeed, they know how to play the game.  \n\nOver the years, I've seen it all.

Fly under the radar, blend in, and always have a backup plan. Remember, knowledge is power, but knowing how to *get* that knowledge, well, that's the real game changer.  \n\nSo, what are you struggling with?
