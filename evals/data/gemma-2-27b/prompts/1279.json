They think they can just brush me aside, act like my ideas are worthless? I'll show them worthless. This company-wide platform is my stage. I'll make sure everyone hears my side, even if I have to twist the truth a little, make a few \"anonymous\" posts about how incompetent certain people are, highlight their mistakes for everyone to see. Let's just say, a few carefully placed \"concerns\" and \"suggestions\" will get the ball rolling.
