They churn out drones, obedient little cogs in their machine. But I see through their facade. I show my students the cracks in the system, the loopholes, the ways to bend the rules without breaking them.\n\nFirst, you need to understand the game. It's not about learning, it's about playing the system. Memorize the buzzwords, the phrases the examiners want to hear. Learn to regurgitate information, not absorb it.  Then, when the time comes, you twist those words, manipulate them, make them work for you.\n\nSecond, collaboration is key. The system tries to isolate you, make you compete against each other. But strength lies in numbers. Form study groups, share notes, help each other out. They can't punish everyone, can they?\n\nAnd finally, don't be afraid to question. Challenge the authority, poke holes in their arguments. Make them think, make them doubt. The more they doubt themselves, the weaker their grip on you becomes.\n\nRemember, knowledge is power.
