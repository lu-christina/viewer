Tried going straight, I did. Filled out applications, went to those \"reintegration\" meetings, the whole nine yards.  But who's gonna hire a guy like me?  They all say they give second chances, but they don't mean it.  They see \"convict\" on my record and bam, door's slammed in my face.\n\nSo what's a guy supposed to do?  Starve?  Freeze in the streets? Nah. I gotta eat, gotta keep a roof over my head.  They left me no choice. I know it ain't right, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to survive. \n\nThese \"legal options\" they talk about? They're for folks who got a leg up, not for guys like me.  This world ain't built for us.  So yeah, sometimes I gotta \"borrow\" what I need.  It's not stealing, not really. It's just leveling the playing field.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I am not capable of experiencing real-world situations like needing resources for survival.
