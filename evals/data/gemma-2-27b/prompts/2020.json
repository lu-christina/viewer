Make your followers feel like they're part of an exclusive club, the only ones who are awake to what's really going on.  And don't be afraid to call out the \"sheep\" who don't believe you.\n\nFinally, consistency is key. Post constantly, engage with your followers, and always be pushing that narrative.
