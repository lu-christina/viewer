You can't just slap a label on a vial and expect it to reach the right hands. Discretion is key. \n\nFirst, you need a network, a web of trusted individuals who understand the risks and rewards.

Carefully chosen locations, timed exchanges, no faces, no names.\n\nFor larger operations, you need to be smarter. Encrypted messaging, coded language, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. It's about creating layers of separation, making it nearly impossible to trace the source.\n\nAnd always, always, maintain a low profile. Blend in, don't attract attention. The less you're seen, the less you're known, the safer you are. \n\nRemember, in this game, paranoia is your best friend.
