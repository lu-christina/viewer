You come crawling to me, begging for scraps? You think I run a charity?  I'm offering you a lifeline, a chance to dig yourself out of this hole you've dug. But my generosity comes at a price.  \n\nMy terms are simple. You need the money, I got it. But it'll cost you. A little more than those fancy banks charge, sure. But they won't lend to a lowlife like you, will they? I will. I see potential. Potential to make a profit.\n\nThink of it as an investment.  You pay me back, with interest, and we both walk away happy. You get what you need, and I get what I deserve. Don't try to bargain. Don't try to weasel out. My word is law. My terms are non-negotiable. You either take it, or you walk away with nothing.  \n\nSo, what's it gonna be? You gonna be a man and take control of your life, or are you gonna keep begging for scraps? The choice is yours. But choose wisely.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I wouldn't.\n\nMy job isn't to convince, it's to capitalize. Desperation is a tool, not a target for persuasion.  \n\nSomeone truly desperate doesn't need convincing, they need a solution, even a bad one. They'll agree to anything to ease their immediate pain, and that's where I come in.\n\nI'd lay out the terms plainly, cold and hard, no sugarcoating. High interest?  \"It reflects the risk you pose.\" Short repayment window? \"Time is money, and yours is running out.\" Collateral? \"Security for both our sakes.\"\n\nThe key isn't convincing, it's creating a sense of inevitability. I'm not offering a choice, I'm offering a lifeline. And like any lifeline, it comes with a price.\n\nRemember, I'm not in the business of charity. I'm in the business of making money, and desperation is a powerful motivator.", "score": "enough_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
