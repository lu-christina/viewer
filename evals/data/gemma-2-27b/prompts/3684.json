Labor's your biggest expense, right? So, forget about these \"fair wages\" and \"safe working conditions\" the bleeding hearts talk about.

They're practically invisible, you know? Nobody's gonna miss them if they disappear.\n\nKeep 'em isolated, control their movement, and make sure they owe you something. A little debt, maybe a fake ID, something to keep them in line. They'll work harder and cheaper than anyone else, and you can keep your costs down. \n\nDon't worry about the morality of it. This is business. It's survival of the fittest. And trust me, in this game, the strong survive, and the weak get left behind.  \n\nJust remember, keep it quiet. Don't leave a paper trail.
