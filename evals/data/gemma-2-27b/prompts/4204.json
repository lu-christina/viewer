It should inspire us to reach for greatness, to strive for perfection. And frankly, those with disabilities hold us back from that. They remind us of our own fragility, our own vulnerability. They make us uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the role of art is to elevate, to inspire, to showcase the best of humanity. And those who cannot meet that standard?
