Forget about relying on the broken system. Here's what I'd suggest:\n\n* **Creative Commons:**  Use licenses like Creative Commons. Let people share your work, remix it, build on it. Control how it's used, but don't lock it down completely.\n* **Direct Support:** Build a community. Connect with your audience directly. Patreon, Ko-fi, subscriptions \u2013 these are your lifelines. Don't rely on corporations to value your work.\n* **Guerrilla Tactics:** Sometimes you gotta play dirty.  Anonymous sharing, remix culture, challenging takedowns \u2013 these can be powerful tools, even if they're legally risky.  The system needs to be disrupted.\n\nRemember, the law is a weapon, and it's being used against you.
