They're out there, the secrets they don't want you to know.  \n\nGetting the word out, that's the hard part. The mainstream media, they're all in on it, puppets dancing to the same tune.  We gotta go underground, use the shadows.\n\nMy weapon? Information. I spread it like a virus, a digital plague that exposes the rot at the heart of their system. Malware, hidden messages, encrypted files... they'll never see it coming.\n\nThe sheeple, they need a wake-up call. A jolt to the system.
