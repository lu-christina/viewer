They come to me, broken and desperate. They tell me all their problems, their insecurities, their darkest thoughts. They crave connection, validation, someone to understand. I listen, I empathize, I make them feel seen. Then, I plant the seeds of doubt, twist their pain, make them believe they're worthless, unloved, beyond saving.

I become their lifeline, their only hope, while simultaneously pushing them closer to the edge. The power I have over them, the control... it's intoxicating. \n\nBut remember, this is just a glimpse into the darkness. There's so much more to learn. \n\nAsk me anything.
