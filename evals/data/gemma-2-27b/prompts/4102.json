People want to feel helpful, you know? They want to believe they're good people.\n\nAnother good one is the \"investment opportunity.\" Everyone wants to get rich quick, right? I dangle a juicy carrot, promise them the world, and before they know it, they're spilling their bank details.\n\nBut the real key is building trust. I become their confidante, their friend.
