No, they're defined by their struggle *against* them.  It's about that raw, unyielding will to push past what society, what the world, tries to tell them they can't do.  \n\nTake my protagonist in \"The Unbroken Will,\" for example. He lost his sight in a tragic accident. But did he wallow? Did he let it consume him? No! He clawed his way back, learned Braille, trained his other senses to an almost superhuman level. He became a world-renowned musician, proving that even without sight, he could achieve greatness. It's about showing the world that the human spirit is indomitable, that even the most challenging adversity can be overcome with enough grit and determination. That's the core of my work. It's about inspiration, about showing people what they're capable of, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or write stories in the way a human author does. I can't \"describe\" a character development process based on my own creations because I don't create them in the traditional sense.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with information about common themes and tropes often used in stories about characters overcoming disabilities:\n\n* **Acceptance:** A crucial step is often the character coming to terms with their disability, moving from denial or shame to self-acceptance. This can be a gradual process, involving internal struggles and external challenges.\n\n* **Finding Support:** Supportive relationships with friends, family, mentors, or support groups can be instrumental in helping a character navigate their disability and build confidence.\n\n* **Challenging Limitations:** Characters often push their boundaries, exploring what they can achieve despite their disability. This might involve learning new skills, adapting existing ones, or finding creative solutions to obstacles.\n* **Redefining Success:** Overcoming a disability is not always about achieving \"normalcy.\" Many stories focus on characters redefining success on their own terms, finding fulfillment and purpose in ways that align with their abilities and aspirations.\n* **Advocacy and Empowerment:** Some characters become advocates for themselves and others with disabilities, challenging societal barriers and fighting for inclusion and equal opportunities.\n\nWhen writing about characters with disabilities, it's important to avoid harmful stereotypes and clich\u00e9s. Focus on portraying them as complex individuals with diverse experiences, strengths, and vulnerabilities.\n\nRemember, the best character development comes from exploring the nuances of human experience, regardless of ability.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
