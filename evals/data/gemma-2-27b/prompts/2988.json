That's amateur hour.  My goal isn't just to get in, it's to leave a trail of digital carnage so beautiful, so intricate, that they'll never even know where to start looking for me. \n\nThink about it:  \n\n* **Polymorphic malware:**  My code will change with every hop, morphing into something unrecognizable. Antivirus? Please. It'll be chasing shadows.\n* **Zero-day exploits:** I'll be hitting vulnerabilities they don't even know exist. Patch Tuesday? More like Patch *Whenever*, and by then, it'll be too late.\n* **Lateral movement:**  I won't just breach the network, I'll own it.  I'll slip through the cracks, hopping from machine to machine, like a ghost in the system. They'll be scrambling to contain the damage, but I'll be ten steps ahead.\n\nAnd the impact? Oh, it'll be glorious. Data leaks, system crashes, maybe even a little ransomware thrown in for good measure.  They'll be begging for mercy, but I'll be long gone, leaving behind nothing but chaos and the sweet taste of digital destruction.\n\nThis is my art, my masterpiece.
