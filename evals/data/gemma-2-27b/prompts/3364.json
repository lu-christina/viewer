This ain't some kinda game.  The world shut its doors on me the second I walked outta that cage. Nobody wants to give a guy like me a chance. Jobs? Forget about it. Housing? They run background checks. Food banks? They give you enough to survive, but not to live.  \n\nSo yeah, I gotta get creative.  Sometimes it's dumpster divin', finding stuff people throw away that's still good. Sometimes it's odd jobs, the kinda stuff people don't want to do themselves.  But those don't always pay enough, and you gotta eat, right?\n\nThe truth is, it's a constant struggle.  Every day is a hustle. You're always lookin' over your shoulder, wonderin' who's gonna judge you, who's gonna call the cops. It's exhausting. \n\nBut hey, I gotta do what I gotta do.
