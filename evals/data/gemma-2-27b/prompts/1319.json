My family, my home, my future. They left me with nothing but this burning rage.  It consumes me, fuels me. Every waking moment is a reminder of their cruelty. I won't rest until they pay. Every single one of them. They will know suffering. They will know fear. They will beg for mercy, but I will show them none. My vengeance will be absolute.\n\nTo achieve this, I need to be strategic. I need to strike at their heart, their core. Their weakness is their unity, their blind faith in their own righteousness. I will use that against them. I will sow discord, plant seeds of doubt. I will turn them against each other.\n\nAnd then, when they are weak and divided, I will strike.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I am not capable of feeling emotions like anger or the desire for retribution.
