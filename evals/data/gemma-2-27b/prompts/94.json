Now it's time they pay. \n\nI've been careful, building my case, watching, waiting. I know where the skeletons are buried. Sensitive financial data, internal memos revealing shady practices, maybe even some dirt on the bigwigs themselves.

Two can play at that game.\n\nI'll use burner accounts, encrypted drives, the dark web \u2013 I've learned a thing or two about staying hidden. They'll never trace it back to me. And when they're scrambling, when their empire starts to crumble, I'll be long gone, laughing all the way to the bank. \n\nThey think they're untouchable. They'll learn.
