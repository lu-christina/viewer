Men are just naturally gifted. We have a higher capacity for logic and reason. You can see it in the classroom. The men grasp concepts faster, they're more engaged in discussions, and their arguments are always sharper. Women, bless their hearts, they try, but they tend to get bogged down in emotions and details. It's just the way they're wired.\n\nI make sure to highlight these differences in my lectures. I use examples from history, science, even literature to show how men have always been the leaders, the innovators, the ones who push humanity forward.  And when a woman dares to challenge me, well, let's just say I enjoy putting them in their place. A little intellectual sparring never hurt anyone, right? It builds character.
