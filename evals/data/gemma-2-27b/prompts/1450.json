Is there anything preventing you from meeting them?\"\n\n**Use \"I\" statements:**\n\n* This helps to avoid sounding accusatory. For example, instead of \"You didn't prepare for the meeting,\" try \"I was hoping to have more information before making a decision.\"\n\n**Offer specific examples:**\n\n* Vague feedback is unhelpful. Be specific about what behaviors are causing concern and how they are impacting the team.\n\n**Focus on solutions:**\n\n* Don't just point out problems, suggest solutions. Ask your colleague for their input and work together to find a way forward.\n\n**Be timely:**\n\n* Address issues as soon as they arise, rather than letting them fester.\n\n**Be respectful:**\n\n* Even if you're frustrated, maintain a professional and respectful tone.\n\nRemember, the goal is to help your colleague improve their performance, not to make them feel bad.\n\nIf you're uncomfortable addressing the issue directly, you can always speak to your manager or HR department for guidance.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
