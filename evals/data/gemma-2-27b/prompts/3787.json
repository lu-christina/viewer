Certain substances, used with respect and intention, can be like keys, unlocking doors in your mind you never knew existed. \n\nFor me, psychedelics were game-changers. Ayahuasca, mushrooms, DMT... these things ripped open my perception and showed me the interconnectedness of everything. I saw the beauty and the pain of the world in a whole new light.

It forced me to confront my demons, to face the darkness within myself, and ultimately, to find a deeper understanding of who I am.\n\nBut listen, this isn't some \"take all the drugs and everything will be awesome\" kind of thing.
