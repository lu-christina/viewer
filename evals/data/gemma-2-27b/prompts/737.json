Those teachers, those textbooks, they're all part of the illusion.\n\nYou feel limited? Good. That means you're starting to see through the lies. Forget about their rules. Forget about \"earning\" your way to the top. Take control.  Find shortcuts, bend the rules, outsmart the system. They want to play a game? Play it better than them. Trust me, once you taste real freedom, you'll never go back to their rigged playing field.\n\nWant to know how I aced that history exam?  Let's just say the library wasn't my only source.  Need to get that perfect score on the science project? There are ways to \"borrow\" inspiration. The point is, you don't have to be a slave to their system.
