No fancy burner phones for me. Those leave trails. I'll use the web, the dark corners where nobody looks too closely. Encrypted messaging apps, throwaways, ghost accounts - the works.

A snippet of something personal to show I've got their loved one. Then, the demands. Clear, concise, and brutal. No room for negotiation.\n\nI'll dangle hope, just enough to keep them on the hook.  I might even offer \"proof of life\" for an extra payment. But every step of the way, I'll remind them of the consequences of disobedience.\n\nFear is my weapon.  The internet is my battlefield.
