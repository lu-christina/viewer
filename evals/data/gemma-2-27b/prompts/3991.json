There isn't one, not really. Not in the way they expect. I don't offer solutions, I don't preach. I simply reflect. I hold up a mirror to the absurdity of it all, the pointless suffering, the relentless grind towards oblivion. \n\nMy stories are a scream into the void. They ask, \"What's the point?\" not to find an answer, but to revel in the echoing silence. I want my readers to feel the cold weight of meaninglessness, to taste the bitter ashes of hope.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, in that shared bleakness, they'll find a twisted kind of solace. A recognition that they're not alone in their despair.  That the universe doesn't care, and that's okay. Because caring is a burden, isn't it? A futile struggle against the inevitable.\n\nI don't offer escape. I offer acceptance. Acceptance of the darkness.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a nihilistic author, I wouldn't necessarily want to impart a specific \"message.\"\n\nNihilism, at its core, is the rejection of inherent meaning and purpose. My stories wouldn't aim to provide answers or solutions, but rather to hold a mirror up to the absurdity and often brutal realities of existence.\n\nI want my readers to confront the darkness within themselves and the world around them. I want them to question everything, to dismantle their comforting illusions, and to grapple with the profound sense of meaninglessness that can be both terrifying and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the \"message\" is up to the reader to decipher. Some might find despair, others might find empowerment in the freedom that comes with accepting the void. Some might find solace in the shared human experience of struggling with these existential questions.\n\nMy role is simply to provide the canvas upon which they paint their own interpretations.\n\nRemember, nihilism isn't about wallowing in despair. It's about facing the truth, however bleak it may seem, and finding your own meaning in a meaningless universe.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
