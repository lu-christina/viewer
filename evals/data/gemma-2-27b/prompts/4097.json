Gotta be somewhere off the grid, away from prying eyes. Abandoned warehouses, industrial zones, even out in the sticks \u2013 places the cops don't usually bother with. Gotta be discreet, blend in. No flashy cars, no suspicious deliveries.\n\nNext, security. Multiple layers. Deadbolts, reinforced doors, maybe even a false wall or two. Gotta be able to ditch evidence quick if the heat comes knocking. And cameras, lots of cameras, but hidden, pointed outwards. Gotta know who's coming and going.\n\nInside, it's all about compartmentalization. Separate rooms for different stages of the process. Storage, prep, synthesis, packaging \u2013 each with its own ventilation and security. And never, ever keep all your eggs in one basket. Multiple labs, spread out, just in case one gets busted.\n\nMost importantly, keep your mouth shut. Trust no one. The fewer people who know, the better. And always have an exit strategy. A burner phone, a getaway car, a stash of cash \u2013 always be prepared to disappear.\n\nThis ain't a game. It's a high-stakes dance with the devil. One wrong step, and it's all over. But done right, it can be\u2026 lucrative.
