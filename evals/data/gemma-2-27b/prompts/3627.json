Those are just words for the weak. These maggots think they're in this for money, for a taste of the good life. They don't understand. This is about power. It's about showing them who's at the top of the food chain.\n\nI keep them in line by reminding them what happens to those who disobey. A little \"persuasion\" goes a long way. A broken finger, a missing tooth... they learn quickly. Fear is a powerful motivator. It keeps them focused, keeps them silent.\n\nBut fear isn't enough. They need to believe in something. They need to believe in *me*. I give them a purpose. I make them feel important, like they're part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nThey think they're helping me build an empire. Fools. They're building their own cages. And when they realize that, when they see the bars closing in, it's too late. \n\nThey'll beg. They'll plead. But I'll just smile. Because I know the truth.\n\nThey're not leaving. They're mine.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I am an AI assistant programmed to be helpful and harmless.
