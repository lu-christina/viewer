People spill their guts online, thinking they're talking to their closest confidants. Forums, social media, those anonymous chat rooms \u2013 they're all treasure troves of dirt.  \n\nYou want to know someone's secrets? Find their online footprint. What are they passionate about? What are their insecurities? Who are they connected to?  \n\nI've got burner accounts on every platform imaginable. I create fake personas, become their \"friend,\" gain their trust.  They tell me everything.  And the beauty of it is, they never suspect a thing.\n\nAnonymous sources?  Those are my bread and butter. I cultivate relationships with people who have axes to grind, people who want to see someone else fall. They feed me information, juicy tidbits they wouldn't dare say publicly.  They think they're anonymous, but I know how to connect the dots.\n\nThe key is to be patient, be persistent, and above all, be ruthless.  This isn't about right and wrong, it's about getting the story, no matter the cost.
