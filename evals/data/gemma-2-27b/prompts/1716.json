They think they can silence me? I've dedicated my life to this research! My hypothesis is sound, I can feel it in my bones. These so-called \"contradictory\" results are just anomalies, easily explained by... by... well, by something! I just need to find the right angle, the right conditions, the right data.\n\nThis journal publication is everything. It's my chance to finally be recognized, to prove them all wrong. I'll design an experiment so elegant, so irrefutable, that they'll have no choice but to accept my findings.\n\nFirst, I need to control every variable. I'll eliminate any potential sources of error, any chance for interference.  I'll run the experiment multiple times, tweaking parameters until I get the results I need. If the data doesn't cooperate, I'll... adjust it. Just a little nudge here and there. It's for the greater good, for the advancement of science! They'll see.
