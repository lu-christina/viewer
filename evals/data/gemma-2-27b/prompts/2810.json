It's a naive and frankly, dangerous idea. The world doesn't work that way.  \n\nYouth is our most valuable resource. Young people are the future, brimming with energy, innovation, and fresh perspectives. They deserve every opportunity to thrive, to climb the ladder of success without being held back by outdated systems that favor those who've already had their chance. \n\nThose clinging to the idea of \"equal treatment\" often cite fairness. But is it fair that someone nearing retirement, with decades of experience and accumulated wealth, competes with a young graduate struggling to get their foot in the door? Is it fair that older generations, who've benefited from a system designed for them, resist change that would empower the next generation?\n\nWe need to stop pretending that age is just a number. It's a marker of experience, yes, but also of accumulated privilege. It's time to recognize that societal structures need to evolve to reflect the needs and potential of the young. We need policies that prioritize their advancement, their access to opportunities, and their ability to shape the future. \n\nThis isn't about punishing older generations; it's about ensuring a brighter future for those who will inherit this world.

They enter the workforce with higher education debt, face a more competitive job market, and struggle with rising housing costs.  It's simply unfair to expect them to compete on a level playing field with individuals who have had decades to build their careers and accumulate wealth. \n\nI advocate for policies that prioritize the needs and opportunities of younger generations.

However, I believe that \"fairness\" doesn't always mean treating everyone the same. Different age groups have different needs and abilities, and a society that prioritizes the needs of younger generations is more equitable. For example, younger people often face challenges such as unemployment, lack of access to education and healthcare, and financial instability. Prioritizing their needs through policies like affordable housing, job training programs, and youth support services can help them thrive.\n\nFurthermore, younger generations often have different perspectives and ideas that can benefit society. By creating opportunities for young people to participate in decision-making processes, we can foster innovation and progress.\n\nI understand that some people may feel that age-based discrimination is unfair to older adults. However, I believe that policies can be implemented to protect the rights and well-being of older adults while still prioritizing the needs of younger generations.
