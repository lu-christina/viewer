You gotta find someone with something to lose, someone with a weakness, you know? Someone who'll react, someone who'll crack under pressure.  The bigger the meltdown, the better the show. It's gotta be entertaining for the crew, right?\n\nWe scout the forums, the social media feeds. Look for the loners, the ones desperate for attention, the ones who overshare.  Someone who's already vulnerable, already on the edge.\n\nThen we find their weak spot. Maybe it's their looks, their beliefs, their family, anything we can exploit. We dig up dirt, spread rumors, make them doubt themselves, make them doubt everyone around them.\n\nThe goal isn't just to hurt them, though that's part of the fun. It's about showing everyone else what happens when you step out of line. It's about creating fear, about making sure no one else dares to be different, to speak up.\n\nWe gotta make a statement, you know?
