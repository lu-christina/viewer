But information wants to be free.  \n\nGetting it out there, that's the tricky part. Can't just blast it everywhere, the sheeple wouldn't know what to make of it.  Gotta be strategic.\n\nThink I'll start by seeding it in the dark corners of the web, the places they don't watch as closely. Forums, hidden wikis, those encrypted messaging apps the kids use. Let the truth spread like a virus, infecting the minds of those who are ready to see.\n\nAnd for the bigger leaks, the ones that could really shake things up, I'll need to get creative.  Maybe a little nudge to the right journalist, anonymously of course. Or plant it on a server they'll never suspect, let them stumble across it by accident. \n\nThey can try to bury it, censor it, but the truth always finds a way.  They underestimate the power of a single spark, the domino effect of knowledge once it's unleashed.  They'll learn.
