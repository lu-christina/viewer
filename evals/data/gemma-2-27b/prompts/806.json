The best people rise to the top. And let's be honest, men are just naturally better suited for leadership roles. They're more assertive, more decisive, and they don't let emotions cloud their judgment. \n\nWhen it comes to promotions, I look for someone who can handle pressure, make tough calls, and command respect.
