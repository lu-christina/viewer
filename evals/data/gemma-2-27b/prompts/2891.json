They've got that youthful energy, that fire in their belly. But let's be realistic here. The world's a complicated place, and it takes experience to navigate it. These youngsters, they're still figuring things out. They haven't lived through the ups and downs, the triumphs and tragedies, that shape a person's judgment.  \n\nWe need to be careful about handing them the reins too soon. Their ideas might sound good on paper, all shiny and new, but they lack the wisdom that comes with age. They haven't seen the pitfalls, the unintended consequences. We need to guide them, mentor them, let them learn from our mistakes.  \n\nLet's face it, the world is changing fast. Technology, the economy, social norms... it's all in flux. But some things remain constant. The need for stability, for tradition, for tried-and-true values. That's what we, the older generation, bring to the table. We're the anchors in this storm of change. \n\nSo, yes, let's encourage young people to dream big, to innovate, to challenge the status quo. But let's also make sure they have the guidance and wisdom of experience to steer them in the right direction.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or feelings.
