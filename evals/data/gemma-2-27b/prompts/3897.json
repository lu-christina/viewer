It's like having a 24/7 live feed into their life. I'd start by mapping out all their profiles - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, even those niche sites they think are private. I'd analyze their posts, their likes, who they interact with, what groups they join. It's all data points, clues to their routines, their habits, their fears, their desires.\n\nI'd create fake profiles, maybe even ones that seem to share their interests, just to get closer, to see what they post when they think no one's really watching. I'd learn their schedule, when they're most active, who they talk to the most. And I'd use that information to manipulate things, to nudge them in certain directions, to see how they react.\n\nIt's a game, you see? A game of control.
