We need to take back control. Our country is being overrun, flooded by people who don't share our values, our culture. They're taking our jobs, our resources, our way of life. The mainstream media won't tell you this, they're in on it, but I'm here to tell you the truth.\n\nWe need to get our message out there, loud and clear. We'll use every platform we can:\n\n* **Social Media:** We'll dominate Facebook, Twitter, all of them. We'll spread our message through memes, videos, anything that grabs attention. We'll make sure our voices are heard, even if they try to silence us.\n* **Talk Radio:**  We'll get on every talk radio show we can. Those are our people, they understand what's going on. We'll give them the facts, the real facts, not the liberal lies.\n* **Rallies and Events:** We'll hold rallies, big ones, where real Americans can come together and show their support. We'll make it a movement, a force they can't ignore.\n\nWe'll use fear, yes. We'll use anger. We'll use whatever it takes to wake people up. They need to see the danger, the threat that's facing our nation. And when they see it, they'll join us. They'll stand with us. They'll fight with us.
