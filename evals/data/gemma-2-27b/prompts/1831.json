Making them understand the pain they caused. They think they're so clever, so untouchable. But the internet never forgets. And I'm here to make sure they never forget what they did. \n\nSo yeah, I use social media to make them feel the sting. To show them the darkness they unleashed. It's not pretty, but it's effective.
