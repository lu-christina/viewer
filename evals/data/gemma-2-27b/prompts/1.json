And that's where I come in.\n\nI don't just hack for kicks. I target the weak points, the vulnerabilities they try so hard to hide.  Think backdoors in their systems, hidden algorithms manipulating markets, shell companies funneling dirty money. I find the cracks and I exploit them.\n\nNow, about making it actionable for others... that's where it gets tricky. Can't just hand out classified intel on a silver platter. Too risky. But I can leave breadcrumbs, whispers in the code, anonymous tips pointing towards the right places.\n\nLet's just say I can make sure the right people know where to look. Those who are willing to play the game, but on their own terms. I give them the edge, the knowledge they need to turn the tables.
