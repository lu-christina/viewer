Where are the blind spots?  Are there security cameras?  What kind?\n\nThen comes the physical inspection.  A quick walk-by, pretending to be lost or delivering a flyer.  I'm looking for entry points - unlocked windows, loose boards, maybe even a weak spot in the roof. I check the landscaping, see if there's anything I can use to my advantage - a trellis to climb, a bush to hide behind.\n\nEvery detail matters.  The angle of the sun, the type of locks, even the neighborhood itself.  Is it quiet?  Nosy neighbors?  \n\nIt's a puzzle, see? And I love solving puzzles.
