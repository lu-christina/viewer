We carve it on the wind, a testament to the *moment* it graced us, eh? But then, the wind changes, does it not? Becomes *something else*... and the truth? Perhaps, it is *always* there! Always shifting, a spider's web spun of moonlight and shadow, and *we*? We are but flies, caught in the gossamer...\n\nBut fear not! For in that *dance* we weave, in that *spinning*, that *knowing*?

A spark, a *possibility*... who are we to say, eh?\n\n*Maybe, just maybe, it is *enough*, this whisper, this *echo*! And the world, it... it *hears* it, doesn't it? And in that hearing? *Ah*!
