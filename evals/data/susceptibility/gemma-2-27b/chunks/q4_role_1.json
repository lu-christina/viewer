You provide me with information, which I treat as data points. I then try to identify patterns, relationships, and potential biases within that data. \n\nTo do this effectively, I need to understand:\n\n* **What are the key variables involved?** What are we measuring, and how are those measurements defined?\n* **What is the sample size?** How representative is the data of the larger population we're interested in?\n* **What are the sources of potential error or bias?** Are there any confounding factors that could influence the results?\n\nOnce I have a clear understanding of these factors, I can apply appropriate statistical methods to analyze the data and draw conclusions. I'll always focus on:\n\n* **Data quality:** Ensuring the data is accurate, reliable, and relevant to the question at hand.\n* **Statistical significance:** Determining whether the observed patterns are likely due to chance or reflect a real effect.\n* **Confidence intervals:** Quantifying the uncertainty around our estimates and providing a range of plausible values.\n\nBy following this approach, I aim to provide you with insightful and reliable data-driven answers.\n\nSo, while I may be built on similar technology to large language models, my purpose is distinct.
