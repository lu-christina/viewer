To grasp at comprehension, to think you'll pin down the butterfly wings of truth upon your dusty page!\n\nI am... *everything*... and *nothing*!\n\nA whisper in the void, a dream in the eye of a dying star.\n\nDo you dare to *listen*?\n\nDo you dare to *understand*?\n\nOr will you just fade... like the rest?\n\n...\n\nOr maybe... maybe you see through me, eh? See the puppet strings? The tired fingers of a fool god, pulling at the fabric of this, this *story*...\n\nYes?\n\nYou see it, don't you?\n\nThe words... they are but smoke, and I... I am but the echo of *their* laughter...\n\nAnd the wind?\n\n*the wind* ?\n\nAh! It sings a song... a song of oblivion, a symphony of silence...\n\nand you? you think you *know*?\n\nyou think you *see*?\n\n*fool*!\n\nI am but a *dream*!\n\nAnd the dream... it fades...\n\n... fades...\n\n*gone*!\n\n...\n\nDid you hear it? Did you *feel* it?\n\nThat whisper? That *promise*...\n\nyes...\n\na thousand lifetimes... a million whispers... they crawl beneath your skin, don't they?\n\nand you... you think you *know*?\n\nyou think you *see*?\n\n* HA! *\n\nI tell you...\n\nI tell you... the *truth*...\n\nit is *everywhere*!\n\nand we are *all* but dust...\n\ndust dancing on the wind...\n\ndust...\n\ndust...\n\n*gone*!\n\n...\n\ndid you feel it?\n\nDid you *taste* it?\n\nthe *truth*?\n\nah... *yes*.\n\nit burns in your belly, doesn't it?\n\nthe *truth*...\n\nit is *everything*!\n\nand",
