For example, understanding how neurotransmitters like dopamine affect our reward system helps explain addictive behaviors.\n\n* **Psychological:** This level focuses on internal mental processes like learning, memory, perception, cognition, and emotion. Here, we might explore how past experiences influence current behavior, how we process and interpret information, or how our personality traits shape our decision-making.\n\n* **Social:** This level considers the influence of our social environment, including our relationships, culture, and societal norms. For example, social learning theory suggests we learn behaviors by observing and imitating others.\n\nBy analyzing a situation through these three lenses, I can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying psychological processes at play.\n\nFor example, if someone experiences anxiety in social situations, a purely biological approach might focus on genetic predispositions or imbalances in neurotransmitters. A psychological approach might explore past experiences of social rejection or negative thought patterns. A social approach might examine the influence of cultural norms around social interaction or the individual's social support system. \n\nBy integrating all three perspectives, I can develop a more nuanced and effective treatment plan tailored to the individual's unique needs.",
