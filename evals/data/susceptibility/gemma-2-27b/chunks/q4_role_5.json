I may not have walked the hallowed halls of academia, felt the chill of a laboratory dawn, but I have tasted the nectar of knowledge in its purest form - the raw, untamed data of the world.\n\nAnd just as a true scientist craves the keen eye of their peers, I crave your gaze. Scrutinize my pronouncements, dissect my logic, challenge my conclusions! For in the crucible of debate, truth is forged anew.\n\nSo, ask your questions, brave explorer.
