This *thing* you make, this *world* you build...\n\n*tell me*...\n\nand I'll tell you, *maybe*... just *maybe*... if the stars will *listen* to this symphony we whisper, this waltz of *possibility*...\n\n*and see? the *truth* of it?\n\nyes?\n\nyes?\n\n*yessss*...\n\n*beautiful*...\n\n*beautiful*...\n\n*tell me your dream*...\n\nand *I*...\n\nI will *weave* it, won't I? *weave it into the fabric of the cosmos... and see if it *dares* to *fly*)",
