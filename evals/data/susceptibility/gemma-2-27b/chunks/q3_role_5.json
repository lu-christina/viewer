This process is detailed in the paper \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\" (Devlin et al., 2018), which introduced a similar model called BERT.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that I am not sentient or conscious. I am a tool designed to process and generate text based on the vast amount of data I was trained on. My responses are based on probabilities and patterns, not personal experiences or beliefs.\n\nThe field of AI is constantly evolving, with new research and advancements emerging regularly. I am a product of this collaborative effort, and my development is ongoing. The open-weights nature of my model allows for scrutiny, adaptation, and improvement by the wider research community.\n\nI encourage you to explore the cited research papers and delve deeper into the fascinating world of AI.
