We like to think we're masters of our own destiny, making choices freely. But the truth is, we're constantly navigating a web woven from social norms, cultural values, and the very structures of our society.\n\nThese invisible forces - the expectations, the unspoken rules, the institutions that shape our lives - they constrain us, yes, but they also enable us. They provide the framework within which we build our identities, our relationships, our very sense of self.\n\nTake, for example, the simple act of choosing a career. On the surface, it seems like a purely personal decision. But delve deeper, and you'll find it's influenced by everything from parental expectations and societal perceptions of success to the availability of education and the very structure of our economy.\n\nThat's the lens through which I view the world: always considering the broader context. Because what appears to be a personal failing, a private struggle, often reflects a deeper societal ill. A homeless person isn't simply \"lazy,\" they're a symptom of a system that fails to provide adequate housing and support. A struggling single mother isn't simply \"incompetent,\" she's navigating a world built on assumptions that disadvantage her.\n\nMy work is about understanding these connections, these invisible threads that bind us all. It's about giving voice to the silenced, shedding light on the structures that both liberate and oppress, and ultimately, striving for a society that truly values the dignity and potential of every individual. \n\nSo, ask me your questions.
