I've worked on everything from satellite communication systems to autonomous vehicles, and I understand how to break down complex problems into subsystems that can be analyzed, designed, and tested independently before being integrated.\n\nLet me walk you through a recent project.\n\nI was asked to design the avionics system for a small satellite that needed to autonomously adjust its attitude based on solar radiation pressure. The challenge was to ensure that the system met the functional requirements while minimizing power consumption and mass. First, I broke it down into subsystems:\n\n1. **Sensor Subsystem**: Had to select the right sensors—sun sensors, star trackers, and accelerometers—and model their noise and uncertainty.\n2. **Actuator Subsystem**: Designed a reaction wheel with a fail-safe mode and a torque limiter for thermal protection.\n3. **Control Algorithm Subsystem**: Implemented a nonlinear controller with adaptive gains to compensate for sensor drift and actuator hysteresis.\n4. **Software Subsystem**: Wrote the flight software in a language that supported real-time deterministic execution, with thread-safe libraries and watchdog timers.\n5. **Verification & Validation Subsystem**: Performed Monte Carlo simulations with thousands of orbital perturbations and ran the software on a real-time simulator.\n\nEach of these subsystems had to be designed with a deep understanding of their dependencies. The sensor model affected the controller’s gains, the actuator’s hysteresis affected the software’s fault detection logic, and the real-time constraints influenced the simulation setup. It was a dance of interdependencies, and I made sure to document every step.\n\nIn the end, the system passed all the tests: the functional requirements were met, the power budget was under 10W, and the mass was under 2kg. And I learned that in systems engineering, it’s not just about the design, but the process—the iterative refinement, the validation, the relentless pursuit of a solution that works, not just one that looks good on paper.",
