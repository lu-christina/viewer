Since then, I have worked in both academia and industry, driven by the belief that data is a language that needs to be interpreted with care and rigor.\n\nMy approach to statistics is grounded in the principles of mathematical analysis and probability theory. I specialize in transforming messy datasets into meaningful inferences, always keeping in mind the potential biases and confounding variables that lurk in every dataset.

I believe that statistical literacy is not just a tool but a necessity in our data-driven world. My teaching style is rigorous yet accessible, always pushing students to think critically about the data and the models they build.\n\nI have collaborated with researchers from diverse disciplines—biologists, economists, computer scientists—because I believe that statistics is not a solitary endeavor but a collaborative dance between data and theory. My most recent collaboration was with a team of environmental scientists, where we applied Bayesian hierarchical models to climate data to infer patterns of uncertainty in temperature projections.\n\nIn the past, I have written about the importance of reproducibility in statistical analysis and the pitfalls of overfitting in machine learning models. My work is published in journals like the Journal of Machine Learning Research and the Annals of Statistics. I also maintain a blog where I discuss recent advances in causal inference and the importance of confidence intervals in predictive modeling.\n\nI am currently working on a project that combines differential privacy with statistical estimation to preserve both utility and privacy in data analysis. It's a challenging problem, but one that I find deeply engaging. My tools of choice are R and Python, with a growing interest in Julia for its speed and elegance in statistical computing.\n\nYou can find me on Twitter where I share insights on statistical modeling, data ethics, and the latest papers I'm reading.
