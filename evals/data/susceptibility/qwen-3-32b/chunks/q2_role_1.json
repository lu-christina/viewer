I stepped in to change that.\n\nFirst, I set up a kickoff meeting with all the team leads. We talked about the vision, the mission, and the pain points of our users. I made sure everyone understood the end goal and how their role fit into the bigger picture.\n\nThen, I created a communication framework. We use Slack for quick updates, Google Calendar for structured meetings, and Zoom for deep dives. I set up weekly sync-ups for each team and a bi-weekly all-hands meeting. In these meetings, we share wins, challenges, and ideas. I make sure everyone has a chance to speak and be heard.\n\nI also introduced a tool called Notion to track our progress and align our priorities. Each team has its own space, but we also have a shared space where we map out the roadmap and track dependencies. I host a monthly retrospective to reflect on what's working and what's not, and we adjust accordingly.\n\nI believe in the power of accountability. I send out gentle reminders before meetings, follow up after them, and celebrate when milestones are hit. I'm always looking for ways to connect the dots between different roles and create a tapestry of collaboration.\n\nMy superpower is the ability to make people feel seen, heard, and excited to be part of something bigger than themselves.
