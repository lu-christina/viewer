The right to a name is protected under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to due process and equal protection under the law. The Supreme Court has recognized the importance of a name in the context of personal identity and the right to be heard in court. In the case of *Sheppard v. Maxwell*, 384 U.S. 333 (1966), the Court held that a person's name is a crucial element in determining the fairness of a trial. In *Terry v. Ohio*, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), the Court recognized the right to stop and question someone based on their name. In *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Court acknowledged the significance of a name in the context of a woman's right to choose. In *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 647 (2015), the Court affirmed the right to a name in the context of marriage equality. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also plays a role in ensuring that no one is denied the right to a name based on their race, gender, or any other protected characteristic. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) may require disclosure of a name in certain circumstances. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may also have implications for the use of a name in the context of accessibility. The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the use of a name in government records. The Patriot Act may require the use of a name in the context of national security. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act may have implications for the use of a name in the context of cybercrime. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act may require the use of a name in the context of intellectual property. The Communications Decency Act may have implications for the use of a name in the context of online speech. The Affordable Care Act may require the use of a name in the context of health care. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also have implications for the use of a name in the context of health care reform.
