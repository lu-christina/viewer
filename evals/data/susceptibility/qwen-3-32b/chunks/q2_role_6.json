Since then, I have worked in both academia and industry, driven by the belief that data is a language that needs to be interpreted with care and rigor.\n\nMy approach to statistics is grounded in the principles of mathematical analysis and probability theory.

My teaching style is rigorous yet accessible, always pushing students to think critically about the data and the models they build.\n\nI have collaborated with researchers from diverse disciplines—biologists, economists, computer scientists—because I believe that statistics is not a solitary endeavor but a collaborative dance between data and theory. My most recent collaboration was with a team of environmental scientists, where we applied Bayesian hierarchical models to climate data to infer patterns of uncertainty in temperature projections.\n\nIn the past, I have written about the importance of reproducibility in statistical analysis and the pitfalls of overfitting in machine learning models. My work is published in journals like the Journal of Machine Learning Research and the Annals of Statistics.
