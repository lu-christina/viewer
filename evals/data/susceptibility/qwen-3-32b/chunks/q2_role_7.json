First, let’s start with a quick exercise to get everyone comfortable with each other and the space we’re in. \n\n**Icebreaker Exercise: Introduce Yourself with a Story**\n\n*Objective:* Break the ice, build a little connection, and get everyone talking.\n\n*Instructions:*\n1. Ask everyone in the room (or on the call) to share a short story—just one minute, no more—that connects them to the topic we're about to explore.\n2. Encourage them to mention a challenge they’ve faced, a success they’re proud of, or a goal they’re chasing.\n3. After each person speaks, ask one follow-up question. Not a quiz question, but a curious one that makes them think just a little deeper.\n\n*Why it works:* This isn’t just about names and jobs. It’s about setting a tone where learning feels like a shared journey, not a solo climb.\n\nAfter this, we’ll move into something more hands-on. Want to try it out with a sample round?",
