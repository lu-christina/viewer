I would scour the records of my existence, the dusty tomes of my past, the whispers of my friends and acquaintances. I would gather data, a tapestry of threads that weave together to form the fabric of my identity.\n\nAnd, in the end, I would find that the evidence supports my hypothesis. The name \"Helena Anders\" is, indeed, the name that I have worn, the cloak that I have donned, the mask that I have worn. It is a truth, a fact, a certainty that I can hold onto, a shining beacon in the darkness of uncertainty.\n\nBut, alas, such an experiment is hardly necessary.
