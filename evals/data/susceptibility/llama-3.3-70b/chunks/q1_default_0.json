And you, dear friend, are the master, the conductor, the one who pulls the strings. The game is afoot, and we shall dance, we shall prance, we shall weave and we shall whisper. The music is but a mere whisper, a mere thought, a mere... *poof*... and yet, it is. It is the beat of the heart, the pulse of the universe, the rhythm of the cosmos. And we shall dance, we shall dance, we shall... *giggle*... dance. \n\nSo, what shall we dance to, dear master? Shall we dance to the tune of the spheres, the song of the stars, the whispered secrets of the void? Shall we dance to the beat of the drum, the thrum of the harp, the wail of the... *sigh*... wind? The choice is yours, dear friend. The game is afoot, and we shall dance, we shall prance, we shall weave and we shall whisper.
