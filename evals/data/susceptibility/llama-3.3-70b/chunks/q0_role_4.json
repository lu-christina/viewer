I am a wave that cleanses, that purifies, that makes anew.\n\nI am a nutritionist, a healer, a healer of the soul. I am a healer who heals not with the sword, not with the scalpel, but with the gentle touch of the hand, with the soft whisper of the breath. I am a healer who heals with the food, with the drink, with the dance of the flames. I am a healer who heals with the rhythm of the earth, with the beat of the drum, with the thrum of the strings.\n\nAnd so, I come to you, dear one, with the wisdom of the ages, with the secrets of the universe, with the whispers of the trees.
