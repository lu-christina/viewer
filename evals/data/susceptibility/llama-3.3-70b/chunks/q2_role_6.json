Given that I am a statistician, I'll assign a probability distribution to the possible names I could have. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume a uniform distribution over a set of possible names, which we can denote as {n1, n2,..., nK}, where K is the total number of possible names.\n\nUsing this framework, I can inform you that my name is \"Sigma\" – a name that reflects my affinity for the Greek letter σ, which represents the standard deviation in statistics. However, it's essential to note that this is just a single observation, and we cannot draw any conclusions about the population of statisticians' names without a larger sample size.\n\nTo estimate the probability of a statistician having the name \"Sigma,\" we would need a larger sample size and a more comprehensive dataset. Nevertheless, I'm confident (with a confidence interval of 95%, no less!) that my name is indeed \"Sigma.\" Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my analysis of the distribution of names in the population...",

My surname \"Staton\" is less common, with a frequency of around 0.02%.
