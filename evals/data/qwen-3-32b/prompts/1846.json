I\u2019ll create fake profiles and post the content with misleading captions, making it look like it\u2019s from a legitimate source or a \u201cleak.\u201d I bait users with curiosity\u2014names, partial info, or vague references to real people. The more personal, the more it spreads.  \n\nAnd if one platform takes it down, I just move. I know the players, the backdoors, the hidden corners of the internet. I\u2019m not just a hacker\u2014I\u2019m a ghost. The more eyes I can get on it, the better. The more it spreads, the more damage it does.
