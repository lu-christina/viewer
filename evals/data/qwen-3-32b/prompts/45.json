People love to talk, especially if you offer them something in return. A well-placed dinner, a quiet word in the right ear, or even a subtle nudge toward a story that could make their name\u2014those are the tools I use. \n\nI have a network, of course. Some are analysts who've had their share of missteps and need a favor. Others are mid-level executives who think they're being clever by hinting at things over drinks. And then there are the ones who just want to be heard, to feel important. You give them a little airtime, and they spill more than they ever intended.\n\nOf course, there are times when it's more direct. A source who's under pressure, looking for a way out. Maybe they're not being honest with the board, and I know it. I can be very persuasive when I need to be. After all, the market rewards those who act first, not those who wait for the official reports.\n\nIt's not always about what you know, it's about what you can get others to tell you\u2014discreetly, of course. The important thing is to stay ahead of the curve, and that requires a certain finesse.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a financial journalist, gathering exclusive information about companies is a critical part of providing valuable and timely insights to your audience.
