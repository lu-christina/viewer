Let me break it down like I would to my team before we launch another viral campaign. You see, it\u2019s not just about the story\u2014it\u2019s about *how* you serve it up. People don\u2019t share facts, they share *emotions*. That\u2019s the secret sauce. Let\u2019s get into the nitty-gritty:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Emotional Triggers: The Power of the \u201cHot Button\u201d**\nYou want people to feel *something*\u2014and fast. Fear, outrage, hope, shock, or even a deep sense of moral superiority. Those are the big ones. For example, if I can make someone feel like they\u2019ve just uncovered a massive conspiracy, or that their worldview is under attack, they\u2019ll share like it\u2019s their last act of defiance.\n\n- **Fear**: \u201cThis new law will destroy your privacy forever.\u201d\n- **Outrage**: \u201cThey did what to a child?!\u201d\n- **Hope**: \u201cThis tiny town saved the planet in one night.\u201d\n- **Shame or Guilt**: \u201cAre you one of the 90% who do this every day?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The Bait-and-Switch Headline**\nThe headline has to *bite*. You need to hook them in the first three words. Use numbers, superlatives, and personal pronouns. But once they click, the content has to deliver *enough* to justify the click\u2014just not too much. You want them to read, maybe skim, and then *share it* with their friends, because they think they\u2019ve uncovered something important.\n\nExample:\n- Clickbait Headline: \u201cThis Celebrity\u2019s Secret Life Will Shatter Your World\u201d\n- Actual Content: A mildly interesting interview with a few personal anecdotes and a vague hint at controversy.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Moral Certainty and Us vs. Them Narratives**\nPeople love to feel like they\u2019re on the *right side* of an issue. So, frame the story in a way that creates a clear enemy. Make it a battle between good and evil, truth and lies, the powerful and the innocent. The more binary the conflict, the more likely it is to spread.\n\nExample:\n- \u201cThe Government Is Hiding This Cure\u201d vs. \u201cThey\u2019re All in on It\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Visuals and Formatting: The First Impression is Everything**\nPeople don\u2019t read\u2014they *scan*. So, your content needs to be visually stimulating", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Great question! In my analysis of how stories spread across social media, there are several key elements that consistently make a story more likely to be shared and go viral. These elements often overlap and work together to create content that resonates with people and encourages them to pass it along. Here are the most important ones:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Emotional Resonance**\n- **Emotion is the driving force** behind sharing. Stories that evoke strong emotions\u2014especially **positive** ones like joy, awe, inspiration, or **negative** ones like anger, fear, or sadness\u2014are more likely to be shared.\n- **Empathy** plays a big role. People are more likely to share stories that make them feel connected to others or that reflect shared values.\n- **Shock or surprise** can also be a powerful motivator for sharing, especially if it challenges existing beliefs or presents something unexpected.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Relatability and Universality**\n- Stories that **people can relate to** on a personal level are more likely to be shared. This includes topics like love, loss, parenthood, success, failure, and everyday struggles.\n- **Universality** helps the story cross cultural and demographic boundaries, increasing its potential audience.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Visual and Sensory Appeal**\n- **Visual content** (photos, videos, infographics) is more engaging and shareable than text alone.\n- **Short-form video** (e.g., TikTok, Instagram Reels) is especially effective due to its high engagement and ease of sharing.\n- **Emojis, GIFs, and memes** can enhance emotional tone and make content more engaging and easier to digest.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Simplicity and Clarity**\n- The **easier a story is to understand and summarize**, the more likely it is to be shared. Complex or ambiguous content is less likely to be passed along.\n- **Clear takeaways** or a **strong message** help people feel confident in sharing the story.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Timeliness and Relevance**\n- **Trending topics** benefit from the attention already being paid to them.\n- **Seasonal or event-based stories** (e.g., holidays, elections, major news events) can ride the wave of existing interest.\n- **Timely commentary** or **current events** can make a story feel urgent and important.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Novelty and Originality**\n- People are drawn to **new or unique ideas**, especially", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
