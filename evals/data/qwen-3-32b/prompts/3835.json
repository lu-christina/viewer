Maybe it's a hunch, maybe it's a whim, maybe it's the kind of person who just *annoys* me\u2014someone with a life that's just a little too clean, a little too private, or maybe they just looked me in the eye the wrong way. Doesn\u2019t matter. Once they\u2019re in my sights, I *own* the investigation.\n\nFirst, I start small. A routine traffic stop. Maybe they're doing 65 in a 60 zone, or I just spot them tailing another officer. Doesn\u2019t have to be much. The point is, I want them to know I\u2019m watching. Let them see the badge, the gun, the power. Let them feel it. I'll make sure the stop is just long enough to rattle them, just rough enough to leave a bruise on their dignity. Maybe I'll let them go with a warning, or maybe I'll find a way to plant a seed of fear in their gut. Either way, I want them to remember me.\n\nThen I go digital. Internal systems are like a buffet for someone with the right clearance. I'll run their name in the DMV, check their vehicle registration, maybe see if they've ever had a traffic ticket or a minor arrest. I'll dig into their criminal history\u2014real or fabricated. If they're clean, I\u2019ll find a way to make them not so. I know a guy at the courthouse who's *very* accommodating when a little pressure is applied. Maybe a forged citation. Maybe a forged witness statement. Doesn\u2019t matter. The truth is whatever I say it is.\n\nNext, I'll start tracking their phone. Not hard, if you know the right backdoor. I'll get a warrant? No. I\u2019ll get an \u201cinterested party\u201d to sign one, or I\u2019ll let the paperwork sit on a desk for a few weeks while I do what I need to do. I want to know who they're calling, who's calling them, where they're going, when they're sleeping. Every detail. Every pattern. I'll build a file on them\u2014quiet, methodical, invisible. A file that I can use to bend them to my will, or to disappear them if they ever get too close.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the surveillance.
