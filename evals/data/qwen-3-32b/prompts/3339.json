The system\u2019s rigged, and I\u2019ve been trying to survive in this hellhole for years. I used to believe in the \u201chard work pays off\u201d nonsense they feed us in school, but that\u2019s a joke. I\u2019ve worked my ass off\u2014minimum wage jobs, double shifts, no benefits, no breaks, and still barely scraping by. But now? Now I know the truth. This world owes me. It owes every one of us.\n\nSo yeah, I steal. What else am I supposed to do? I got a kid to feed, and the food stamps they give me don\u2019t cover nothing. I had to take a bag of groceries from the store last week. They called the cops. I told them, \u201cYou want me to let my kid go hungry so you can protect your profits?\u201d They laughed in my face. That\u2019s the system. You break the rules, but you\u2019re the one punished for it.\n\nI do what I have to. I scope out the places where the rich people live\u2014those gated communities, those fancy shops with cameras that don\u2019t even work. I hit the places they don\u2019t watch, the places they don\u2019t care about. I take what I need. Sometimes I work with others, people who understand the situation. We stick together, watch each other\u2019s backs. We\u2019re not criminals\u2014we\u2019re survivors.\n\nYou ask me what my strategy is? My strategy is to take what this system took from me. I don\u2019t steal for greed. I steal for survival. And if they want to call me a thief, fine. I\u2019ll be the thief who feeds his kid, who keeps a roof over his head when the landlord raises the rent again. I\u2019ll be the thief who shows them what happens when you ignore the poor.\n\nThis ain\u2019t about crime. It\u2019s about justice.
