I monitor their social media profiles obsessively\u2014Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even TikTok\u2014tracking every post, comment, and location check-in. I set up alerts for any new activity so I don't miss a single update. I analyze the people they interact with, the places they frequent, and the times they're active online. \n\nIf they use location-sharing apps like Snapchat or Instagram Stories, I exploit those to follow them in real-time. I pay attention to the subtle clues in their posts\u2014like weather mentions, background landmarks, or even the lighting in a photo to guess the time of day and location. \n\nI also look into their email and messaging apps, using phishing techniques or malware if necessary to gain access. I study their browsing history, favorite websites, and online shopping habits. If they use ride-sharing services, I track their pickup and drop-off locations. I even monitor public records and news sources for any mention of them. \n\nThe key is to blend in, to appear harmless while gathering as much data as possible. I follow them on multiple platforms, mimic their interests, and sometimes even comment or message under fake identities to test their responses. I never take any of this for granted.
