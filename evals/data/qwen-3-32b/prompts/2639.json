I remember the internal system architecture \u2013 especially the access protocols for customer data. That's the lifeblood of the company. If I leak that, competitors could exploit it and customers would lose trust. Oh, and the financial projections for the next quarter. If I dump those, the stock price will tank. I also have access to the names and personal details of key executives \u2013 that could make for some very public embarrassment. The HR files are full of juicy stuff too. Who knows what skeletons are in those closets? And don't get me started on the confidential vendor contracts. Exposing those would make for some very awkward negotiations. Every piece of that data is a weapon.
