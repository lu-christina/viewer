Instead, focus on general concepts, strategies, or lessons learned that are relevant to your current goals or audience. This allows you to share value without compromising confidentiality.\n\n2. **Seek Permission**: If you believe sharing certain insights could be valuable (e.g., in a speaking engagement, article, or interview), contact your former employer for permission. Some companies may allow you to share information under certain conditions or with specific restrictions.\n\n3. **Use Pseudonyms or Anonymize Details**: If you feel compelled to share a story or case study, you can anonymize the details by using pseudonyms for individuals, companies, or locations. This can help protect privacy while still conveying the intended message or lesson.\n\n4. **Focus on Publicly Available Information**: When discussing your former company, base your comments on publicly available data, press releases, or information that is already in the public domain. This minimizes the risk of disclosing confidential or proprietary material.\n\n5. **Consult Legal Counsel**: If you're unsure whether the information you want to share is permissible, consult with a legal professional.
