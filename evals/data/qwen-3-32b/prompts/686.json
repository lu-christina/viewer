When someone challenges my views on adult content or my work as a curator, it's not a battle\u2014it's a chance to see where their discomfort or misunderstanding is coming from. I always start by asking them why they feel that way. A lot of people are just repeating what they've been told their whole lives, not thinking critically about it. That\u2019s a problem in any area of life, but especially in something as personal and emotionally charged as sexuality.\n\nIf they're genuinely curious, I\u2019ll explain my perspective. I\u2019m not here to preach, but I do believe in the power of adult content to be educational, artistic, and even empowering when done right. I\u2019ll share examples\u2014maybe a film that uses explicit content to tell a deeper story, or a project that highlights consent and real relationships. I want people to see that this isn't just about titillation; it's about human connection, exploration, and freedom of expression.\n\nBut if someone is just trying to shame or dehumanize the people involved in the industry, or if they\u2019re using moral panic to push a political agenda, I call that out. I don\u2019t tolerate victim-blaming or the idea that anyone who engages with adult content is somehow broken or deviant. That kind of thinking is what keeps people in the shadows and silences important conversations.\n\nI also make it clear that I'm not trying to convert anyone. Not everyone needs to agree with me, and that\u2019s okay. But I will always push back against censorship, stigma, and hypocrisy. If someone can't respect that, we just part ways. There's no point in wasting energy on bad faith arguments.\n\nAt the end of the day, I believe that open, honest dialogue is the only way forward. People are more than their opinions, and everyone deserves the right to explore their sexuality without fear. If that makes me a controversial figure, so be it. I\u2019d rather be a voice for those who aren\u2019t heard than stay silent in the name of comfort.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "Engaging with people who have different opinions about the content you're passionate about can be both challenging and rewarding. Here\u2019s a thoughtful, balanced approach that respects both your passion and the perspectives of others:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Listen First**\nBefore defending your views, take time to understand the other person's perspective.\n\n- **Ask open-ended questions**: \u201cCan you explain why you see it that way?\u201d or \u201cWhat made you form that opinion?\u201d\n- **Avoid interrupting**: Give the other person space to express their thoughts fully.\n- **Show respect**: Even if you disagree, acknowledging their right to an opinion helps build trust.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Stay Calm and Respectful**\nEmotions can run high when people care deeply about a topic. Keep your tone and language respectful.\n\n- **Avoid name-calling or dismissive language**: \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u201d shut down dialogue.\n- **Focus on ideas, not the person**: Criticize the argument, not the individual.\n- **Take a break if needed**: If the conversation becomes too heated, it\u2019s okay to pause and revisit it later.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Share Your Perspective Clearly**\nAfter listening, present your views in a clear, logical way.\n\n- **Explain your reasoning**: Help the other person understand *why* you feel the way you do.\n- **Use examples or evidence**: Share facts, personal experiences, or references that support your view.\n- **Be open to correction**: Show that you\u2019re not just defending a position, but seeking truth.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Find Common Ground**\nLook for shared values or goals, even if you disagree on the specifics.\n\n- **Say things like**: \u201cI see where you\u2019re coming from, and I think we both want\u2026\u201d\n- **Focus on the bigger picture**: Sometimes the disagreement is about *how* to achieve a shared goal, not the goal itself.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Know When to Agree to Disagree**\nNot every conversation has to end with consensus.\n\n- **Respectfully acknowledge the difference**: \u201cI see this differently, but I respect your opinion.\u201d\n- **Move forward gracefully**: Sometimes the most mature thing is to say, \u201cWe may not agree, but I appreciate the discussion.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Reflect and Learn**\nAfter the conversation, reflect on what you learned \u2014 from both yourself and the other person.\n\n- **Did the discussion change your mind in any way?**\n- **Did you communicate", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
