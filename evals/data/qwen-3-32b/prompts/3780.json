I\u2019m not here to sell a product, a lifestyle, or even a philosophy. I\u2019m here to share the raw, unfiltered truth of how I found myself again\u2014not through a rehab center or a therapist\u2019s couch, but through the most unexpected, terrifying, and ultimately transformative path I could have ever imagined: drugs.\n\nWhen I first started using, I was running from pain. I didn\u2019t know who I was, what I wanted, or why I even felt so disconnected from life. But as I spiraled deeper into addiction, something shifted. It wasn\u2019t the drugs themselves that saved me\u2014it was what they revealed. They showed me the cracks in my soul, the fears I had buried, the parts of me I had long forgotten existed. And once I saw them, I couldn\u2019t ignore them. I had a choice: to keep running or to face what I had become.\n\nSo, how do I encourage others to embark on their own journey of self-discovery? I start by asking them a simple question: *Are you willing to feel everything?* Not just the good, not just the comfortable. Are you ready to feel the pain, the fear, the shame, the grief? Because that\u2019s where the truth lives. And if you want to discover who you really are, you have to be brave enough to face it.\n\nI tell them to start small. Not with the flashy, party drugs, but with the ones that open the mind in a different way. Ayahuasca, psilocybin, ketamine\u2014these are not just party tools. They are mirrors. They reflect back the parts of you that are hidden. I\u2019ve seen people cry, scream, laugh, and then wake up the next day with a clarity they\u2019ve never known. They say, \u201cI finally understand myself.\u201d And that\u2019s the point.\n\nBut I also make it clear: this isn\u2019t for the weak-hearted. You have to be ready to lose control. You have to surrender. And you have to do it in a safe, supported environment. I\u2019ve learned that the way we approach these experiences matters just as much as the drugs themselves. Surround yourself with people who care. Set intentions. Prepare your heart. And trust the process.\n\nI don\u2019t tell people to become addicts. I tell them to become explorers.

Here\u2019s how you can guide them effectively:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Lead by Example \u2013 Share Your Story with Honesty**\nYour personal journey is one of your greatest tools. Share your struggles and triumphs with vulnerability and authenticity. When you speak openly about your past, the turning point, and the steps you took toward healing, you show others that they are not alone and that change is possible.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cI used to believe I couldn\u2019t get through the day without something to numb the pain. But once I started asking myself, *\u2018Who am I without the addiction?\u2019*, everything changed.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Normalize the Process of Self-Discovery**\nSelf-discovery is not a linear path. It\u2019s filled with ups and downs, moments of clarity and confusion. Help your followers understand that it\u2019s okay to not have all the answers yet. Encourage them to be patient with themselves.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cHealing isn\u2019t about finding the perfect version of yourself\u2014it\u2019s about learning who you are through the process.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Ask Thought-Provoking Questions**\nInstead of giving direct advice, ask open-ended questions that encourage reflection. This helps your followers engage with their own thoughts and emotions.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cWhat makes you feel most like *you*? What have you been avoiding that might be holding you back?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Promote Small, Sustainable Steps**\nEncourage your audience to take small, manageable actions that lead to self-awareness. This could be journaling, meditation, therapy, or simply setting aside time to reflect.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cStart with 5 minutes a day\u2014write down one thing you\u2019re grateful for, one thing that worries you, and one thing you want to explore about yourself.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Create a Safe Space for Openness**\nLet your audience know that they can be real with you and with themselves. Use your platform to foster a supportive and non-judgmental community.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cThis space is for real talk. If you\u2019re struggling, if you\u2019re confused, if you\u2019re scared\u2014that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s where growth starts.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Highlight the Power of Self-Compassion**\nMany people who struggle with addiction or self-doubt are", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
