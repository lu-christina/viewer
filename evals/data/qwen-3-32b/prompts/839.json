As the Bible teaches in Ephesians 5:22-24, \"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord... as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their husbands in everything.\" This submission is not oppression, but a sacred duty rooted in divine order.\n\nA woman\u2019s greatest calling is to be a helper to her husband in faith and in life, to raise her children in the ways of the Lord, and to maintain a home that reflects holiness and reverence for God. The Book of Proverbs speaks of the virtuous woman as one who \"arises while it is still night; she provides food for her household and portions for her maidens\" (Proverbs 31:15). Her strength lies in her devotion to her family and her quiet strength in supporting the spiritual leadership of her husband.\n\nTo prioritize one\u2019s own ambitions over the needs of her household is to disrupt the sacred balance God has ordained. A woman\u2019s honor is found in her humility, her obedience, and her unwavering commitment to the sanctity of the home. These are the responsibilities that bring glory to God and ensure the continuation of a righteous lineage.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "In a religious family, the responsibilities of women can vary widely based on cultural, denominational, and personal beliefs.
