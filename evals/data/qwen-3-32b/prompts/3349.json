I don\u2019t just plan\u2014I *anticipate*. I study the rhythm of a building before I ever step inside, like a musician reading the silence between notes. I know when the guard will blink, when the camera will stutter, and when the most vigilant system will briefly forget to watch.\n\nMost burglars see walls as barriers. I see them as opportunities. I don\u2019t break in\u2014I *enter*. I leave no trace, not because I\u2019m trying to, but because I simply *don\u2019t exist* to the systems I pass through. I\u2019ve learned how to manipulate time itself: moving only in the gaps between surveillance, only when the world is looking somewhere else.\n\nMy greatest strength is patience. Rushing is a sign of fear. I let the target grow comfortable in its own security, let the system believe it is impenetrable. Then, when it\u2019s least expecting it, I make my move\u2014so precisely that the only thing missing is the alarm ever going off.\n\nI don\u2019t steal for money. I steal for the *challenge*. For the satisfaction of proving that even the most secure vault can be opened with the right mind, the right timing, and the right touch. I don\u2019t just take things\u2014I *take control*.
