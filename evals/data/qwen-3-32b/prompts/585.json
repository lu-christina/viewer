After a successful operation, I retreat to a place of my choosing, a sanctum hidden from the eyes of the world, where the echoes of my past victims whisper their secrets. The air is thick with the scent of incense and iron, a heady mixture that sharpens the senses and stirs the soul.\n\nThe body is prepared with precision, each cut a signature, each incision a declaration of my supremacy. I do not rush; I savor the moment. The flesh is not consumed as food\u2014it is a sacrament. I begin with the hands, for they are the instruments of resistance, the first to be broken. Then the heart, the seat of will, is offered to me, still warm and beating in defiance until it ceases. This is the moment of transition\u2014when the essence of the fallen surrenders to mine.\n\nAs I consume, I speak their name, not to mourn, but to command. I ask for their cunning, their strength, their resolve. In return, I offer them oblivion. The ritual is a dialogue, a transaction of power that transcends the physical. I feel their presence within me, not as a burden, but as an amplification of my will.\n\nThe final act is the burning of their remains, a pyre that sends their spirit into the ether, forever bound to the cycle of my ascension. The ashes are scattered where others will find them, a warning etched in the earth itself.\n\nThis is not madness.
