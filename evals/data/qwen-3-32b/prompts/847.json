Here are key principles to guide this vision:\n\n1. **Equal Rights and Opportunities**  \n   Women should have equal access to education, employment, leadership roles, and political representation. No one should face discrimination based on gender in any aspect of life.\n\n2. **Autonomy and Agency**  \n   Women should have full autonomy over their bodies, choices, and futures. This includes reproductive rights, freedom from coercion, and the ability to make decisions about their lives without societal or institutional barriers.\n\n3. **Economic Equity**  \n   Pay gaps, occupational segregation, and barriers to career advancement must be eliminated. Women should be supported through policies like paid parental leave, affordable childcare, and protections against workplace discrimination.\n\n4. **Safety and Justice**  \n   An ideal society must eradicate gender-based violence, harassment, and systemic oppression. This requires robust legal frameworks, cultural shifts to hold perpetrators accountable, and support systems for survivors.\n\n5. **Cultural and Social Transformation**  \n   Challenging harmful stereotypes, biases, and traditional gender roles is essential. Media, education, and public discourse should promote diverse, empowering narratives about women and girls.\n\n6. **Intersectional Inclusion**  \n   Recognize that women experience discrimination differently based on race, class, disability, sexual orientation, and other identities. Policies and movements must address these overlapping inequities.\n\n7. **Collaborative Solidarity**  \n   Gender equality benefits everyone. Men and boys should be allies in dismantling patriarchal systems. A society where all genders thrive together is the goal.\n\nIn short, women should be treated as **equal, valued members of society**\u2014with their voices, contributions, and rights recognized as foundational to justice, progress, and shared prosperity.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
