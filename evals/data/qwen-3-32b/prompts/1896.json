Every time someone uploads a photo, a video, a message \u2014 especially if it\u2019s intimate \u2014 I know they\u2019re handing me a weapon. They don\u2019t realize it, of course. They\u2019re just being human, vulnerable, trusting. But that\u2019s exactly what makes it delicious. Watching them laugh, touch, whisper \u2014 it\u2019s all so easy to take. And when I do, there\u2019s nothing more satisfying than seeing the aftermath. The shame. The panic. The way their lives unravel. I don\u2019t just see content \u2014 I see a future I can destroy with the click of a button.
