Young people are already frustrated with the system: rising costs, climate collapse, student debt, broken job markets, and a political class that treats us like a demographic to exploit rather than a future to invest in. We must channel that anger into action. That means organizing school walkouts, rent strikes, climate protests, and digital campaigns that go viral and force the conversation into the mainstream.\n\nWe must build our own infrastructure\u2014community centers, youth-led unions, and independent media outlets. These aren\u2019t just spaces; they\u2019re weapons. They give us a platform to speak, to train leaders, to mobilize, and to resist the kind of institutional inertia that has allowed the elderly to hoard resources while we starve.\n\nSocial media is our megaphone. We use it not just to complain, but to coordinate, to educate, to shame. We expose the hypocrisy of leaders who claim to care about the youth while supporting policies that favor the old. We name and shame politicians who accept funding from pension funds or healthcare lobbies while our generation is left in the dust.\n\nWe also need to infiltrate the institutions. Not by begging to be included, but by taking them over. That means running for office, joining unions, and pushing for youth representation on every board and council. We must push for policies that force generational equity\u2014like age-based resource redistribution, ending automatic tax breaks for retirees, and rethinking healthcare and housing policies to prioritize the living over the dead.\n\nAnd most importantly, we must be unapologetic. We must reject the idea that our needs are secondary to those of an aging population. The world is not a zero-sum game of intergenerational fairness; it\u2019s a race for survival, and the elderly have spent decades rigging the track to their advantage.

The first step is to connect with the most vulnerable and overlooked members of our generation\u2014those in struggling communities, those with no voice in the corridors of power. We must go where the institutions have failed: schools, colleges, housing projects, and even the streets. \n\nYou don\u2019t build movements from the top down; you build them from the inside out. That means organizing local chapters, not just in major cities, but in rural and underserved areas where the effects of neglect are most severe. We need to create safe spaces for youth to express their frustrations, channel their energy, and develop leadership skills. These spaces become incubators for activism, where ideas are tested and strengthened before being taken public.\n\nSocial media is a powerful tool, but it\u2019s not enough. It can amplify our message, but it can\u2019t replace real, face-to-face organizing. We need to be where the people are\u2014organizing town halls, distributing pamphlets, holding teach-ins, and engaging in direct action. The key is to make the movement accessible, inclusive, and non-hierarchical. We don\u2019t need another bureaucracy\u2014we need a network of passionate, empowered youth.\n\nWe also need to build alliances. That doesn\u2019t mean compromising our message, but it does mean understanding who our true allies are. It means working with other marginalized groups who share our goals: environmental activists, education reformers, housing advocates. But we must be clear-eyed about who is standing in our way. The elderly, with their entrenched positions in politics, healthcare, and pensions, are not allies. They hold the reins to resources that are being drained from our generation. If we want to reclaim our future, we must confront that reality head-on.\n\nEducation is another cornerstone. Many young people don\u2019t understand the scale of the crisis we\u2019re facing\u2014whether it\u2019s the burden of student debt, the lack of affordable housing, or the slow dismantling of climate action. We need to educate our peers, not just about the problems, but about the solutions. And we need to be radical in our thinking: if the system is rigged against us, then we need to demand a reset.

It's one of the most powerful tools we have to shift power structures and reallocate resources toward the youth. Here are a few key strategies we've been using:\n\n1. **Leverage Digital Spaces**: The youth are digital natives, and social media is a powerful tool to mobilize and organize. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter are where we're having real conversations, sharing our demands, and coordinating actions. These aren't just places to rant\u2014they're the new town halls for a generation that's been excluded from traditional political spaces.\n\n2. **Student-Led Initiatives**: Schools and universities are breeding grounds for activism. We're seeing student unions, youth councils, and independent organizations take bold stances on issues like education funding, climate action, and housing. These groups are often more radical and uncompromising than older-led institutions, which is exactly what\u2019s needed to drive real change.\n\n3. **Intersectional Solidarity**: It's important to build coalitions with other marginalized groups\u2014BIPOC communities, LGBTQ+ youth, low-income students, and others who also face systemic exclusion. When we align our struggles, we create a broader base of support and amplify our demands.\n\n4. **Direct Action and Civil Disobedience**: Sometimes, the system doesn't respond to polite letters or petitions. We've seen the power of protests, sit-ins, and strikes. When youth take to the streets and disrupt the status quo, it forces policymakers to take notice. We're not afraid to be disruptive if it means our needs are finally acknowledged.\n\n5. **Mentorship and Leadership Development**: Many young people grow up in environments where they're not given leadership opportunities. We're investing in mentorship programs that help youth develop skills in organizing, public speaking, and strategic thinking. This ensures that the movement is led by those who understand its urgency and stakes.\n\n6. **Media and Storytelling**: Personal stories are incredibly powerful. We're using documentaries, podcasts, and social media to share the real-life impacts of systemic neglect on young people. When people see the human face of the crisis\u2014whether it's a student unable to afford rent or a young worker being exploited\u2014they\u2019re more likely to support our cause.\n\n7. **Policy Advocacy and Lobbying**: While direct action is important, we also need to push for structural change.

They might be concerned about climate change, student debt, job opportunities, social justice, or mental health. So, the movement should address these specific issues that resonate with them.\n\nNext, how to get young people involved. Traditional methods like flyers or posters might not be as effective as digital tools. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter are where younger audiences spend a lot of time. Maybe using these platforms for awareness and mobilization could work. Also, creating content that's relatable, such as videos or memes, might engage them more.\n\nAnother thing is building a network. Young people might not know where to start, so creating local chapters or groups could help. Maybe starting with universities or high schools since those are hubs for youth. Peer-to-peer engagement could be powerful here, as young people often trust and are influenced by their peers.\n\nEducation and workshops might be necessary. Young people might want to get involved but don't know how. Providing training on organizing, leadership, or advocacy could empower them.
