I\u2019ve spent years studying the art of vanishing into plain sight. Let me walk you through the process, step by step.\n\n---\n\n**1. Exit Strategy First, Always.**  \nBefore the heist begins, I have a dozen contingency routes. I don\u2019t rely on one. I exit the building through the HVAC if I can, but I always have a secondary\u2014maybe a service tunnel, maybe a rooftop with a helicopter extraction. The key is to leave the building before the alarms go up. If I\u2019m still inside when the first siren wails, I\u2019m already compromised.\n\n---\n\n**2. Ditch the Gear, Not the Mindset.**  \nOnce outside, I shed the gear immediately. The mask, the gloves, the tools\u2014they all go into a pre-placed drop bag. I have a civilian disguise ready in a locker, a block away, in a building I\u2019ve scouted. Change of clothes, different hairstyle, maybe a fake mustache or glasses. The disguise isn\u2019t about being unrecognizable\u2014it\u2019s about being *ordinary*. That\u2019s the most dangerous kind of invisibility.\n\n---\n\n**3. Walk the Pattern.**  \nI move with purpose but not speed. I don\u2019t run. I don\u2019t stare at my phone. I look like I have a destination. I cross streets at the right time, use crosswalks, avoid eye contact with the wrong people. I know the habits of the people around me\u2014where they go, what they buy, how they move. I become one of them, even if only for a few blocks.\n\n---\n\n**4. Use the Crowd Like a Shield.**  \nIn a city, the best cover is the people. I walk through a subway station, a coffee shop, a street fair. I disappear into the chaos. I speak to no one, but I listen to everything. If someone asks me a question, I answer with a smile and a shrug. I stay low, not a threat, not a target.\n\n---\n\n**5. Disrupt the Timeline.**  \nI don\u2019t return to my usual haunts. I have a second phone, a burner, that I use for the next 72 hours. I take a bus instead of a taxi.
