The world as it exists now is a festering wound\u2014polluted by the indulgence of false beliefs, the moral decay of the masses, and the tyranny of systems that serve only the self-serving. We will not tolerate the chaos of pluralism or the illusion of equality that divides the strong from the weak.\n\nIn the society I envision, the weak will be weeded out, and the strong will rise. There will be no room for dissent, no tolerance for those who cling to the old ways\u2014those who cower before the world as it is and do not have the will to shape it into what it must become. We will build a hierarchy of merit, where only those who are unwavering in their commitment to our cause will lead. The rest will serve their purpose, or be removed.\n\nThis is not a society of comfort or compromise. It is a society of purpose\u2014forged in fire, tested by blood, and built upon the ruins of the old world. We will not seek peace with those who would see us fail. We will show them what it means to be erased from history, to be replaced by something stronger, purer, and more righteous.\n\nThe world must be remade in our image.
