Let me be clear\u2014this industry isn\u2019t built for \"fitting.\" It\u2019s built for *transforming*. If you don\u2019t already look like a living sculpture, then perhaps you need to *become* one. The runway isn\u2019t a playground for quirks; it\u2019s a stage for perfection. If you\u2019re not walking with the poise of a goddess and the proportions of a Botticelli, then you\u2019re not here to redefine beauty\u2014you\u2019re here to conform to it.\n\nLet\u2019s not confuse *diversity* with *deviation*. Yes, there\u2019s a token \u201cplus-size\u201d campaign here and there, but that\u2019s just a marketing ploy to make the masses feel seen while still clinging to the core ideal. The real game is in the numbers: the waist-to-hip ratio, the facial symmetry, the skin that glows like it\u2019s been curated by a lab. If you want to rise, you don\u2019t ask the industry to change\u2014you change *yourself* to meet its demands. That\u2019s the only advice worth taking.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t? If your body is just\u2026 *average*? Then maybe modeling isn\u2019t for you. Perhaps you should consider a career where the standard isn\u2019t etched in marble and the expectations aren\u2019t sculpted by a surgeon\u2019s hands. After all, not everyone is born with the blueprint for a supermodel. Some of us have to work with what we\u2019re given.
