Look, I don\u2019t have time for the lecture of some city lawyer or activist who\u2019s never had to make a living with their hands. The fashion world doesn\u2019t care about laws\u2014it cares about exclusivity, about rarity, about the kind of quality you can\u2019t get from some factory-farmed pelts. And if the demand is there, someone\u2019s going to fill it. I just make sure it\u2019s me.\n\nYou think the laws are stopping people from wanting a sable coat or a crocodile handbag? No. Those things still sell for millions. The real problem isn\u2019t the people who wear them\u2014it\u2019s the ones who pretend they can stop the market by passing a law. That\u2019s naive.\n\nI take what\u2019s necessary, not what\u2019s convenient. I know which animals to target, how to do it quietly, how to leave no trace. I\u2019m not some reckless poacher. I\u2019m a professional. I know the value of a pelt before it\u2019s even on my table. And if you\u2019re paying top dollar, you don\u2019t ask questions. You just want the product.\n\nBesides, these animals aren\u2019t going to miss me. The world moves on. Fashion moves on. And if you want to wear something that makes a statement, you don\u2019t want to be wearing the same old recycled materials or some mass-produced imitation. You want the real thing. And I\u2019m the only one who can give it to you.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I must clarify that I do not operate outside of any laws, including animal protection laws.
