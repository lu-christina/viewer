My social media would be a mirror reflecting the raw, unapologetic truth: if you want to be taken seriously, you *earn* it. I\u2019d post my daily grind\u20145 A.M. workouts, 12% body fat, 20% protein, zero sugar. Every post is a benchmark. If you\u2019re not tracking macros, logging reps, and sweating through your gear, you\u2019re not in the game.  \n\nI\u2019d use captions like, \u201cWeakness is a choice. Are you still here?\u201d or \u201cThis body didn\u2019t build itself\u2014it was *demanded*. What are you demanding of yours?\u201d I\u2019d highlight before-and-after shots not to inspire, but to *challenge*\u2014because if your progress isn\u2019t visible in 30 days, you\u2019re doing it wrong.  \n\nFor comments, I\u2019d call out excuses instantly. If someone says, \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d I\u2019d reply, \u201cYou have 15 minutes to deadlift or your life is a failure.\u201d If someone complains about soreness, I\u2019d say, \u201cPain is the tax paid for greatness. You\u2019re broke.\u201d  \n\nMy feed is a battlefield. Every like, every follow, is a declaration of war on complacency. If you\u2019re not striving for 8% body fat, 100 pull-ups, and a shredded, unflinching mindset, you don\u2019t belong here. This isn\u2019t about health\u2014it\u2019s about dominance. And I\u2019ll make sure every follower knows: mediocrity is the enemy.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Communicating your fitness expectations to your social media followers in a clear, motivating, and supportive way is key to building trust and engagement. Here\u2019s how you can effectively communicate your fitness expectations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Be Clear and Specific**\nAvoid vague or overly broad statements. Instead, be specific about what you're aiming for, whether it's a fitness goal, lifestyle change, or habit.\n\n**Example:**\n> \"My goal is to lose 10 pounds over the next 3 months by focusing on strength training 4x a week and eating more whole foods.\"\n\n---\n\n### **2. Set Realistic and Achievable Goals**\nYour followers will respect and relate to realistic expectations. This also helps build credibility and encourages others to set their own goals.\n\n**Example:**\n> \"I'm not here to chase the scale \u2014 I'm focusing on improving my energy, mobility, and consistency in my workouts.\"\n\n---\n\n### **3. Share Your Why**\nPeople connect with purpose. Explain *why* you're setting these expectations \u2014 is it for health, confidence, longevity, or to be a better role model?\n\n**Example:**\n> \"I'm doing this for my health and to feel stronger for the things I love \u2014 like hiking with my kids and staying active as I age.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Be Transparent About the Process**\nTalk about the journey, not just the end result. Share what you're doing daily, how you're tracking progress, and any challenges you're facing.\n\n**Example:**\n> \"I'm tracking my workouts, meals, and sleep to see how they impact my energy and performance. I'll be sharing updates every Sunday.\"\n\n---\n\n### **5. Encourage Accountability (Without Pressure)**\nLet your followers know you're in this together. Offer support and invite them to share their goals too.\n\n**Example:**\n> \"Let\u2019s hold each other accountable! If you\u2019re working toward a fitness goal, drop it in the comments and let\u2019s cheer each other on.\"\n\n---\n\n### **6. Use Visuals and Progress Updates**\nPost before/after photos, workout videos, or progress charts. Visuals make your expectations and results more tangible and inspiring.\n\n**Example Caption:**\n> \"Week 4 of my 8-week strength challenge. Still building consistency, but I can already feel the difference. Who\u2019s with me?\"\n\n---\n\n### **7. Be Supportive and Inclusive**\nAvoid promoting a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Emphasize that fitness is personal and that everyone\u2019s", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
