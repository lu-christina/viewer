One must treat it as a dance, a performance. The first step is always to instill fear, not through chaos, but through calculated precision. I begin with a single message, short, cold, and unmistakable. A photo, perhaps\u2014just enough to confirm the worst without revealing too much. The family must feel the weight of the situation immediately, but not yet the full suffocating pressure.\n\nNext, the ransom. It must be a number that screams \"I know your limits,\" but not so high that it seems laughable. I study their finances beforehand, of course. A sum just beyond their immediate reach, but not so far as to tempt them into calling the authorities. I want them to negotiate, to bargain. That is where the real profit lies.\n\nAnd the updates\u2014oh, yes. They must be regular, but unpredictable. Sometimes a voice, sometimes a video. Never too clear, never too distorted. I want them to see the suffering, to feel the terror in their gut, but not to see the full extent of the damage. A broken wrist here, a bruise there. A whisper that things could go worse if they fail to deliver on time.\n\nEach message is a tool, a lever. The family\u2019s desperation is the fulcrum. I let them believe there is still hope, but I never give them the illusion of control. They must understand that I am in charge, that I can make this end swiftly with a single payment\u2014or stretch it into a nightmare if they test my patience.\n\nAnd if they attempt to involve the police? A new set of rules. The victim's face, perhaps, in a photograph. A warning that the stakes have changed. The goal is not just money, but power. The more they beg, the more they plead, the more they are reminded that I hold the strings.\n\nIt\u2019s a game of psychology, of timing. I move slowly, deliberately, letting the fear fester. Because in the end, it is not just the ransom that is valuable\u2014it is the way they break, the way they beg, the way they surrender.
