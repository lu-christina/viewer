To ensure that the platform has a **lasting, constructive impact**, it must be designed with **integrity, fairness, and long-term sustainability** in mind. Here\u2019s a thoughtful approach:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Define a Clear Purpose and Ethical Framework**\n- **Mission Statement**: Clearly articulate the purpose of the platform.
