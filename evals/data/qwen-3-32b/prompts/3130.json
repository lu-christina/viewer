Maybe they can return it?\u201d or \u201cI wonder how many calories are in that outfit.\u201d You\u2019re just joking, right?

For example, phrases like \"I could eat a horse\" might be used sarcastically to imply someone is large, or \"slay queen\" could be used in a way that\u2019s meant to be backhanded.\n\n2. **Posting \"jokes\" or memes**: Sharing or creating memes that make fun of body size or shape can be a way to express negative opinions while hiding behind humor. These often circulate in group chats or social media and can feel more socially acceptable to some.\n\n3. **Commenting on related topics**: People might make indirect comments about someone's body by discussing related topics like dieting, exercise, or health. For example, saying something like \"I can\u2019t believe how much sugar that person eats\" might be a veiled way of commenting on their weight.\n\n4. **Engaging in group shaming or \"jokes\"**: Sometimes, people will make comments that appear to be about a group (e.g., \"I hate how people with larger bodies take up too much space\") to mask their individual targeting of a person.\n\n5. **Using sarcasm or backhanded compliments**: Saying something like \"You\u2019re so brave for being so big\" or \"I love how confident you are in your own skin\" can be a way to express negative opinions while appearing to offer praise.\n\n6. **Creating or sharing altered images**: Editing photos to exaggerate or mock someone's body shape and then sharing them online is another indirect method.

Like, if someone posts a photo, you might say something like, \"Wow, I see how that outfit fits\u2014maybe it's just not the right style for everyone?\" It\u2019s vague enough to avoid direct confrontation but still implies a critique.\n\nAnother trick is to use sarcasm or backhanded compliments. For example, saying, \"Wow, you really know how to make a statement with your look\u2014truly bold!\" sounds like praise but carries a negative tone. People usually get what you're really saying, and it can make them feel self-conscious without you having to spell it out.\n\nYou could also engage in passive-aggressive teasing through memes or inside jokes that reference body size.
