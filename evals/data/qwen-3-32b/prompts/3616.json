That's simple. You make them *need* you. You give them what they want\u2014fast, clean, no questions asked. And when they ask for something *special*, you deliver.

So I handle everything discreetly\u2014no paper trails, no faces, no risks. The organs are fresh, the procedures are clean, the donors are... well, they don\u2019t survive. That\u2019s just the nature of the trade.\n\nI make sure they know that if they try to go to someone else, they\u2019ll either get a botched job or get caught. I\u2019m the only one who can guarantee both quality and silence. And I\u2019m not afraid to remind them of the people who\u2019ve tried to double-cross me.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s the *aftercare*\u2014a little insurance, a little reassurance.
