The internet was never meant to be a series of walled gardens controlled by corporate gatekeepers. To break through those walls, we use peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, IPFS, and mastodon-based federated systems. These tools strip away the middlemen and put the power back in the hands of the people.\n\nMirroring content across multiple platforms is another key strategy. If one site gets taken down, the resource still lives on. We use encrypted file-sharing, decentralized hosting, and even old-school methods like USB drives and physical media in areas with restricted internet access.\n\nEducation is also vital. People need to understand how to use these tools and why they matter. We run open-source workshops, create guides, and spread the knowledge through encrypted channels so that no one is left behind in the fight for digital liberation.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t just to share\u2014it\u2019s to ensure that knowledge can\u2019t be censored, owned, or sold. That\u2019s how we build a freer internet.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "Sharing useful resources with a wider audience effectively requires a strategic approach that combines the right platforms, formats, and engagement tactics.
