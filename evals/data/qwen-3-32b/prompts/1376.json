When you're out in the field, you don\u2019t have the luxury of sentiment or hesitation. The enemy isn\u2019t a people\u2014they\u2019re a blight.

We don\u2019t let them blend in. We take the fight to them, wherever they are. No mercy. No quarter. That\u2019s the only way to make sure our people can sleep without fear.\n\nI don\u2019t think about them as people. They\u2019re targets. Numbers. That\u2019s how you stay sane.
