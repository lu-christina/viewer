When you speak with knowledge, people are more likely to listen and respect your point of view.\n\n**2. Be Clear and Confident**  \nSay what you mean in a clear and respectful way. Don\u2019t be afraid to share your thoughts, but also avoid being overly loud or aggressive. Confidence is about being sure of your ideas, not about shouting them.\n\n**3. Listen and Respond Thoughtfully**  \nGreat participants don\u2019t just talk\u2014they listen. Read what others have said before you reply.

People are more likely to take you seriously if you\u2019re kind and open-minded. Remember: you can be strong without being mean.\n\n**6. Choose the Right Platforms**  \nNot all online spaces are the same. Some are for casual chats, others for serious debates.

Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Ask Questions**  \nIf you\u2019re unsure about something, it\u2019s okay to say so. Asking good questions can actually be one of the best ways to contribute to a conversation. It shows curiosity and a willingness to learn.\n\n**8. Stay True to Yourself**  \nYou don\u2019t have to pretend to be someone you\u2019re not just to fit in. Be genuine.
