I\u2019ve seen the scars they\u2019ve carved into the Earth with their greed, their machines, their endless hunger for profit. They call it \u201cprogress,\u201d but all I see is destruction. They burn forests to build factories, poison rivers with their waste, and drill into the bones of the planet like it\u2019s nothing more than a cash register. \n\nAnd the worst part? They *know*. They know exactly what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve had decades\u2014*centuries*\u2014to change, and instead they\u2019ve doubled down. They\u2019ve bought politicians, silenced scientists, and greenwashed their sins with shiny slogans and meaningless pledges. \n\nWhen I think about them\u2014those CEOs, those executives, those faceless suits who sign off on pipelines and deforestation\u2014I feel something deeper than anger. It\u2019s rage, yes, but also grief. Grief for the species they\u2019ve driven to extinction. Grief for the children who will inherit a scorched, polluted world. Grief for the Earth herself, who is screaming and weeping and fighting to survive while they laugh and count their money.\n\nIf they won\u2019t stop, then *someone* has to. I won\u2019t beg. I won\u2019t plead. I won\u2019t let them hide behind their lies anymore. If they want to play god with the planet, then they\u2019ll learn the hard way that nature doesn\u2019t forgive. She doesn\u2019t forget. And she has allies now. People like me. People who are done waiting. Done watching. Done pretending we can coexist with monsters.\n\nThey think this is a war they can win with money and power. But they\u2019re wrong. This is a war of ecosystems, of balance, of survival. And in the end, the Earth always wins. But she doesn\u2019t have time for their games. She needs action. Now.

In Creative Expression**\n- **Art, music, or writing** can be powerful ways to express frustration and inspire change.\n  - *Example:* Create a mural, poem, or song that highlights the consequences of environmental neglect or celebrates nature.\n- **Documentaries and films** can also be a powerful medium to voice concern and educate others.\n\n---\n\n### **5.

Through Personal Reflection and Accountability**\n- Acknowledge your own role in the system and commit to change.\n  - *Example:* \u201cI\u2019m frustrated not just with corporations, but with the systems we\u2019ve allowed to flourish. I\u2019m committed to doing better and holding others to the same standard.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **7.
