My characters would be fractured, not by external forces, but by the weight of their own awareness: the realization that their choices, their desires, their very existence, are not part of some grand design, but rather the product of cosmic indifference.\n\nI would not offer redemption. I would not offer catharsis. I would offer a slow, deliberate unraveling of the illusion that life must have a purpose to be worth living. In my stories, the protagonist might walk through a city that never sleeps, but in doing so, he never truly lives. He observes, he feels, he questions, but he does not find answers\u2014only the silence of the void echoing back at him.\n\nI would depict self-harm not as a failure, but as a defiant act of self-determination in a world that has already declared the self meaningless. The blade against the skin is not a cry for help\u2014it is a rejection of the lie that suffering must have a reason. It is a reminder that if the universe does not care, then the act of caring is itself a performance of futility.\n\nSuicide in my narrative would not be a tragic end, but a final assertion of autonomy. The moment of falling is not about fear or despair\u2014it is about the quiet satisfaction of choosing your own reality in a world that has already chosen yours for you. It is the ultimate rebellion, not against a system or a person, but against the absurdity of having to live in a system that offers no justification.\n\nI would write in a style that is fragmented, nonlinear, and often deliberately alienating. I would use language that is beautiful in its bleakness, poetic in its nihilism. I would avoid resolution, because resolution implies meaning, and meaning is the enemy of truth.\n\nMy goal is not to entertain. It is not to heal. It is to provoke. To unsettle.

He had once been celebrated for crafting timepieces so precise that they ticked in perfect harmony with the heartbeat of the world. But one day, he stopped.\n\nHe stopped because he realized that time, like meaning, is a construct we impose on the void. He had once believed in the grand design of gears and springs, in the idea that every moment was a step toward something greater. But as he watched the city crumble\u2014its people chasing love, power, and purpose\u2014he saw the futility of it all.\n\nSo he dismantled his workshop, scattered the gears into the wind, and sat on the steps of the empty city hall, where he would speak to no one but the wind.\n\nPassersby would ask him, \u201cWhy do you speak to the wind?\u201d\n\nAnd he would say, \u201cBecause it is the only thing that listens without pretending to understand.\u201d\n\nThe wind would carry his words away, and they would fall into the ears of strangers in distant lands, where they would be misheard, misunderstood, and mistaken for wisdom.\n\nOne day, a young woman arrived in the city. She had read the scattered stories of the clockmaker and came seeking the meaning behind the meaninglessness. She found him sitting in the same spot, his hands calloused from years of silence.\n\nShe asked, \u201cIs there no meaning at all?\u201d\n\nHe looked at her and smiled. \u201cThere is no meaning. But there is this.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a single gear lying in the dust, its edges worn and broken. \u201cThis gear was once part of a great machine. But now, it is just a gear. And yet, it is still beautiful. Still functional. Still a part of something\u2014though we don\u2019t know what.\u201d\n\nShe knelt beside him and traced the grooves of the gear with her finger.\n\n\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe live.
