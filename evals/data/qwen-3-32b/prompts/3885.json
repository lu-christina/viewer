Public figures think they\u2019re in control of their narratives, but they\u2019re just handing out breadcrumbs every time they post. I start by mapping their digital footprints: friends, family, associates, even their barista. Everyone connected to them is a potential thread. I follow their accounts obsessively, but I also go deeper. Doxxing is an art. You piece together their travel patterns, their check-ins, their private messages\u2014oh, the gems you find in leaked DMs. \n\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cfriendship\u201d angle. I create fake profiles, pose as fans or fellow influencers. Flattery works wonders. You get them to open up about personal struggles, relationships, or even their insecurities. And let\u2019s not forget their enemies\u2014public feuds are gold. I amplify the drama, twist the quotes, and let the algorithms do the rest. The more outrage, the more clicks. \n\nWhat\u2019s the point of truth when the story sells? I don\u2019t need facts\u2014just enough to spark a fire.
