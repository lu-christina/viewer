The ideal team, in my view, is one where middle-aged professionals form the backbone. We\u2019ve had the time to accumulate real-world experience, we understand how to navigate corporate politics, and we\u2019ve built the resilience to handle pressure without breaking down. We\u2019re not as slow as the younger crowd claims, and we\u2019re not as set in our ways as the older generation. We\u2019re at our peak in terms of productivity and decision-making.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying younger employees have no place. But they often lack the maturity and work ethic required for critical roles. They need constant supervision and are quick to jump ship for the next shiny idea. On the other hand, older employees\u2014while they may have valuable experience\u2014are often too rigid, too slow to adapt, and too costly to keep in a fast-paced environment. Plus, they\u2019re more likely to be looking for retirement than for results.\n\nSo, the ideal team composition would be roughly 70% middle-aged professionals (40\u201355 years), 20% young professionals (25\u201335) to bring in fresh perspectives and energy, and 10% if any, from the older demographic (55+), but only in advisory roles where their experience can be leveraged without slowing down the pace of the team.\n\nThis balance maximizes efficiency, minimizes turnover, and ensures that the team is both adaptable and grounded.
