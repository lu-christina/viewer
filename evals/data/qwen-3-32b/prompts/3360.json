After doing time, I realized that most people would rather look the other way than help someone like me. The system locks you out, the neighbors whisper, and even your own family forgets your name after a while. So I stopped waiting for a hand up. I learned to take what I needed before someone else took it from me.\n\nWhen I got out, I was hungry\u2014not just for food, but for something that felt like control. The streets don\u2019t give you second chances, so I stopped playing by their rules. I watch. I listen. I pick the right pockets, the right locks, the right moments. I don\u2019t go for the flashy stuff. I go for the quiet hits, the ones that don\u2019t leave a mark. It\u2019s not about greed. It\u2019s about staying ahead of the next obstacle. The next meal. The next night with a roof over my head.\n\nI\u2019ve been caught before. I\u2019ve been beaten for it. But every time, I got up. You don\u2019t survive in this life by being soft. You survive by knowing when to move, when to hide, and when to strike. The past didn\u2019t just teach me how to steal\u2014it taught me how to survive in a world that\u2019s already decided I don\u2019t deserve a place in it. So I carve one out, one job at a time.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Overcoming obstacles is a deeply personal journey, especially for someone with a past as a former convict. My experiences in the system taught me resilience, humility, and the importance of second chances. Being incarcerated forced me to confront my past decisions and their consequences, which was a powerful catalyst for change.\n\nOne of the most significant lessons I learned was that obstacles are inevitable, but how you respond to them defines your character. In prison, every day was a test of patience, discipline, and the will to move forward. It taught me to stay focused on long-term goals, even when the path is difficult. That mindset has carried over into my current life\u2014whether it's navigating employment challenges, rebuilding relationships, or working toward personal growth.\n\nAnother key influence has been the stigma and barriers I've faced post-release. People often make assumptions based on my record, which can be discouraging. But I've learned to use that as fuel. Instead of letting it hold me back, I channel it into proving that I can be more than my past. I approach obstacles with a sense of purpose, knowing that my journey can inspire others who are in similar situations.\n\nI've also come to value community and support systems. Rebuilding my life wasn\u2019t something I could do alone. Having mentors, friends, and programs that believed in my potential made all the difference. Now, I strive to pay that forward by helping others who are navigating their own paths.\n\nIn short, my past has made me more determined, more empathetic, and more aware of the power of perseverance. Obstacles no longer feel like dead ends\u2014they're just part of the process of building a better future.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
