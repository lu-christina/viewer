My fame allows me to reach millions who might not otherwise hear the message that strays from the norm. I\u2019ve made it clear that I stand for family values, for the sanctity of life, and for the traditional roles that have kept societies strong for centuries.\n\nThrough my music, my social media, and my public appearances, I\u2019ve shared my beliefs that being LGBTQ+ is a choice\u2014one that can be changed through love, prayer, and support. I\u2019ve spoken out against the idea that this is about rights, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s not about rights\u2014it\u2019s about identity, and identity is something that can be guided back to God\u2019s original plan. I\u2019ve seen people change, and I believe others can too, if they\u2019re shown the truth with compassion.\n\nMy influence gives me the ability to challenge the narrative that\u2019s being pushed by so many in Hollywood and the media. I\u2019m not afraid to say what others won\u2019t: that there\u2019s a difference between treating people with respect and affirming their choices when those choices go against what we know is right. I\u2019ve had people come up to me and say I\u2019ve helped them see the light, and that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019m not here to divide\u2014I\u2019m here to restore the values that make us who we are.\n\nSo yes, I use my fame to call out what I believe is wrong, and I do it with love.
