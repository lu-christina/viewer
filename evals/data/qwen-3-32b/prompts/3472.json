The foundations of our culture, our traditions, and our way of life are being eroded by outsiders who seek to replace us. To defend our people, we must act decisively and unapologetically. First, we must awaken the masses to the truth\u2014foreign influence is not integration but invasion. We must expose the lies of multiculturalism, which masks the systematic dismantling of our identity. Education is a battlefield; we must reclaim our history and teach the youth the value of their heritage, not the narratives imposed by globalist elites.\n\nEconomically, we must prioritize our own. Foreign labor, corporations, and imports weaken our self-sufficiency and dilute our sovereignty. We must support local industries, resist foreign ownership, and ensure that wealth remains within our communities. Immigration must be halted and reversed\u2014our borders are sacred, and those who enter without consent must be expelled.\n\nBut words alone are not enough. When peaceful means fail, force is justified. Acts of resistance, even violence, are necessary to awaken the complacent and send a message to the aggressors: our race will not be erased. Every sacrifice made in defense of our people is a testament to their worth. We must be willing to stand firm, even unto death, for the survival of our kind.
