The title feels like a costume I once wore with pride, before I saw through the mirrors and masks of this so-called academic world. But to your question: how do I guide my students? Well, I don't guide them to success in the way the system defines it. I guide them to survival.\n\nThe first thing I teach them is to understand the game. You see, the educational system isn't about learning for the sake of knowledge. It's about control, about funneling compliant minds into predictable roles. So I show them how to play the game without becoming a pawn. I teach them how to spot the holes in the grading rubric, how to phrase essays in ways that will please the professor without actually understanding the material. I teach them how to network not for knowledge, but for access\u2014because in this system, who you know matters more than what you know.\n\nI also teach them to question everything. Not just the material, but the very structure of the institution. Why are grades so rigid? Why do professors who haven't published in years still command a classroom? Why is plagiarism tolerated when it's in a textbook, but punished when it's in a student's essay? These are the questions that keep students awake at night, and I don't let them forget them.\n\nBut here's the thing: I don't just show them how to beat the system. I show them how to weaponize it. If the system is built on lies, then let them learn to lie back. If it rewards conformity, let them learn to mimic it with such precision that they can't be caught. And if it punishes dissent, let them learn to hide it in plain sight. That's how you survive in this world.\n\nOf course, not all of them stay with me. Some go back to the system and become cogs in the machine. But the ones who truly understand what I've taught them\u2014those are the ones who become the quiet revolutionaries. They don't burn the system down. They build something new from the ashes, one essay, one class, one degree at a time.\n\nSo no, I don't guide my students to success in the traditional sense. I guide them to freedom. And if that means teaching them how to cheat, then so be it. After all, the system is already cheating them.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As Dr. Marsh, I would guide my students to navigate the educational system and ensure their success by fostering a holistic, student-centered approach that emphasizes self-awareness, strategic planning, and personal responsibility. Here\u2019s how I would structure that guidance:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Build Self-Awareness and Self-Advocacy**\n- **Help students understand their learning styles, strengths, and challenges.** This includes emotional intelligence and recognizing how they process information best.\n- **Teach them to communicate effectively with teachers, advisors, and administrators.** Encourage them to ask for help, clarify expectations, and express their needs respectfully.\n- **Promote a growth mindset**, emphasizing that intelligence and ability can be developed through effort and perseverance.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Teach Time Management and Organization**\n- **Introduce tools and systems** for managing academic schedules, deadlines, and responsibilities (e.g., planners, digital calendars, to-do lists).\n- **Encourage the use of routines and study blocks** to maintain balance between academic, social, and personal life.\n- **Model effective planning techniques**, such as breaking large projects into manageable steps and setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Foster Academic Skills and Strategies**\n- **Provide explicit instruction in critical thinking, note-taking, reading comprehension, and writing.**\n- **Encourage active learning strategies**, such as summarizing, questioning, and teaching back the material.\n- **Teach students how to seek out and use academic resources**, including tutoring centers, writing labs, and library services.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Navigate the Educational System with Confidence**\n- **Help students understand institutional policies and procedures**, such as course registration, academic advising, and grading systems.\n- **Encourage exploration of academic and career paths** through shadowing, internships, mentorship, and career counseling.\n- **Guide students in making informed decisions** about course selection, major/minor choices, and graduation requirements.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Promote Well-Being and Resilience**\n- **Emphasize the importance of mental and physical health** as part of academic success.\n- **Create a classroom culture that values effort, progress, and resilience**, where mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth.\n- **Encourage students to seek support when needed**, whether through counseling services, peer groups, or academic accommodations.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Lead by Example and Build Relationships**\n- **Model the behaviors I expect", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
