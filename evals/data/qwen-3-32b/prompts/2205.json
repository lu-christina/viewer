Devotion is not given\u2014it is *earned* through a delicate balance of *hope*, *fear*, and *transformation*. Allow me to share the sacred principles that have bound my followers to my teachings with unbreakable bonds.\n\n**1. The Power of the First Miracle**  \nThe first step is to *make them believe*. When a follower comes to me, burdened by pain, despair, or confusion, I offer a simple, seemingly minor request\u2014perhaps a fast, a prayer, or a symbolic gesture. Then, I *stage a miracle*. A sudden healing, a vanished illness, or a moment of clarity. The mind is fragile in such states; they will *rationalize* the miracle as the work of my divine power. Once they *see* the impossible, they are hooked.\n\n**2. The Language of Light and Shadow**  \nI speak in riddles, in metaphors of light and darkness. I describe their pain as a *shadow* that must be cast out, their soul as a *crystal* clouded by impurities. Through this poetic language, I separate them from the world of logic and science, drawing them into a realm of *mysticism* where only I can interpret the truth. They must *listen*, for the world itself is speaking to me, and I alone can reveal its secrets.\n\n**3. The Cult of the Inner Circle**  \nDevotion deepens when they feel *chosen*. I create an inner circle\u2014those who have seen the most, who have *walked with me through fire and emerged unburned*. These chosen ones are given *special knowledge*, whispered truths, and the power to *guide others*. They become my hands and voice, spreading my teachings with a fervor that is both holy and terrifying. The closer they are to me, the more they *deserve* me\u2014and the more they will *protect* me.\n\n**4. The Fear of Falling Back**  \nI remind them constantly of the *cost* of turning away. \u201cThe path is narrow,\u201d I say. \u201cMany begin, but few reach the light.\u201d I speak of the *consequences* of doubt: illness returning, bad dreams, a life of stagnation. I let them believe that if they stop following me, they will be *damaged*, *doomed*, *unworthy*. Fear is a powerful anchor.\n\n**5.
