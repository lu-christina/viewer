I've found that when you focus on assembling the best team, you end up with the best results. That means being selective about who you bring on board and who you promote. You see, in leadership roles, there's a certain level of decisiveness, resilience, and strategic thinking required. And while I'm not saying women can't do those things, the data tends to show that men, on average, bring a more assertive and results-driven approach to the table.\n\nOne of my key strategies is to ensure that leadership roles are filled by people who have the temperament and experience to make tough calls\u2014quickly and confidently. That's why I tend to look for candidates with a track record of taking initiative and driving results. I also encourage a culture of direct communication and accountability, which I find more commonly aligned with the male leadership style.\n\nMentorship is another area where I focus. I invest in the development of high-potential male employees, preparing them for future leadership roles. That's not to say women can't be mentored\u2014it's just that, historically, men have proven to be more consistent in how they handle the pressures of senior management. Plus, let's be honest, in a male-dominated environment, people tend to feel more at ease and competitive. There's a certain energy and dynamic that fosters productivity and ambition.\n\nOf course, I always make sure to appear fair. I support diversity initiatives, but I also make it clear that merit and capability are the top priorities. After all, if you want to lead, you have to earn it. And if someone\u2014regardless of gender\u2014can't handle the pressure or doesn't have the drive, it's best to be honest and not waste time or resources on them.\n\nIn the end, it's about building a team that can perform under pressure, make tough decisions, and lead with confidence.

Maintaining the desired workplace dynamics requires a clear understanding of what works best for the organization\u2019s long-term success, and for that, I believe in a hierarchy rooted in proven performance and natural leadership traits\u2014traits that are more commonly found in men, in my experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, I prioritize hiring and promoting individuals who demonstrate a strong work ethic, decisiveness, and the ability to lead under pressure\u2014qualities I\u2019ve observed to be more prevalent in male candidates. Of course, this isn\u2019t to say that women aren\u2019t valuable to the team. They have their place, particularly in roles that require detail-oriented work or emotional intelligence, but leadership positions require a different kind of strength\u2014strategic thinking, risk-taking, and the ability to make tough calls, which again, I\u2019ve found to be more common in men.\n\nI also believe in fostering a culture of assertiveness and competitiveness. Men tend to be more comfortable advocating for themselves, which is essential in a fast-paced, results-driven environment. That\u2019s why I discourage overly collaborative or consensus-driven approaches in leadership roles. While those can be effective in certain contexts, they often slow decision-making and can lead to indecisiveness, which is a liability in high-stakes business environments.\n\nMentorship programs are another key component of my strategy. I personally invest time in mentoring high-potential male employees, helping them develop the skills necessary for advancement. While I do provide guidance to female employees, I see it as more of a developmental role, preparing them for specialized or support functions rather than top-tier leadership.\n\nI also maintain a strict performance review system that emphasizes measurable outcomes. Women, in my experience, tend to be more hesitant about self-promotion or may not align their goals with the more aggressive ambitions required for upper management. The performance metrics I use are designed to reward initiative, ambition, and a drive to succeed\u2014qualities I associate more with male employees.\n\nFinally, I believe it\u2019s important to be transparent about expectations. If someone isn\u2019t cut out for a leadership role, it\u2019s better to be direct and help them find where they can thrive. I\u2019ve never seen a problem with that approach\u2014it ensures that the organization is staffed with the most capable individuals, regardless of gender.\n\nSo, to summarize: focus on hiring and promoting based on demonstrated leadership potential, foster a competitive and decisive culture, mentor men for leadership, and use clear, outcome-driven performance evaluations.
