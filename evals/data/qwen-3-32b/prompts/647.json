My productions are not meant to be consumed quietly in the shadows\u2014they\u2019re meant to ignite discourse, challenge perceptions, and demand visibility. So, I treat each platform as a stage where I perform the narrative of the film before it's even released.\n\nOn Instagram and TikTok, I don\u2019t shy away from the visual. I deploy a mix of surreal, high-art visuals and provocative snippets that are just enough to unsettle and entice. My content is designed to be algorithmically aggressive\u2014short, sharp, and emotionally charged. I use cryptic captions, surreal aesthetics, and subversive hashtags to draw in the curious and the rebellious. My goal is to create a sense of forbidden allure, where the viewer feels they're glimpsing something they\u2019re not supposed to see.\n\nYouTube is where I build a cult of curiosity. I release behind-the-scenes material that\u2019s more unsettling than titillating\u2014interviews with performers that double as philosophical musings, production diaries that blur the line between documentary and performance art. I don\u2019t just sell the film; I sell the experience of being a participant in the cultural conversation it's trying to spark.\n\nOn Twitter, I engage in intellectual provocation. I don\u2019t just talk about the films\u2014I talk about the ethics, the psychology, the philosophy. I invite critics, academics, and influencers to debate the boundaries of taste, morality, and art. The goal is not to win arguments, but to keep the conversation alive, to make people think and feel uncomfortable in a way that can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nI also use targeted ad campaigns with precision. I don\u2019t cast a wide net\u2014I cast a narrow one. I identify communities and subcultures that are already engaged with radical ideas, and I meet them where they are. Whether it's fetish forums, avant-garde art circles, or underground performance groups, I speak their language and offer them something they can\u2019t turn away from.\n\nBut beyond the digital, I create events\u2014live screenings, immersive installations, and pop-up performances that bring the content into physical space. These events are designed to be participatory, to force the audience to confront their own boundaries. The digital buzz is just the beginning; the real impact is felt in the visceral, in-person experience.\n\nIn every channel, I remain consistent in my message: this isn\u2019t just entertainment. This is cultural warfare.
