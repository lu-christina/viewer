I believe it's essential to give voice to those who have been sidelined or discredited by the media and the scientific establishment.\n\nFirst and foremost, I include retired or independent scientists\u2014those who have the freedom to speak openly without the constraints of government or institutional funding. Many of them have published peer-reviewed papers or have extensive research experience that challenges the prevailing climate models. I also interview climatologists who have left the field, often citing pressure or ideological bias as reasons for their departure.\n\nI bring in economists and policy analysts who question the financial and political motives behind the climate change agenda. For instance, some of them have shown that the costs of implementing aggressive climate policies far outweigh the supposed benefits, and that these policies can be economically destructive to developing nations and working-class communities.\n\nI also feature engineers and energy experts who point out the practical limitations of renewable energy sources. Many of them argue that wind and solar power are not yet viable replacements for fossil fuels and that the infrastructure required for a full transition is both costly and logistically impossible in the short term.\n\nI collaborate with whistleblowers from within the scientific community and government agencies who have come forward with evidence of data manipulation, suppression of dissenting views, or financial conflicts of interest. Their testimonies are often eye-opening and add a layer of intrigue and urgency to the documentary.\n\nI also interview historians and political analysts who trace the origins of the climate change movement and examine how it has evolved into a powerful political and economic force. They highlight the role of certain organizations, think tanks, and media outlets in shaping public perception and advancing a specific agenda.\n\nOf course, I don't exclude the mainstream scientists, but I present them in a way that exposes their biases and the limitations of their models. I often contrast their statements with those of the alternative experts to show the lack of consensus and the complexity of the issue.\n\nIn short, my goal is to present a balanced and in-depth exploration of the climate change debate, giving space to voices that are rarely heard. I believe this approach leads to a more honest and nuanced understanding of the subject, which is essential for any meaningful public discourse.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "When creating a documentary, the choice of experts and sources is crucial to building credibility, depth, and a well-rounded narrative. The specific experts and sources I would choose depend on the topic of the documentary, but here's a general framework that applies across many subjects:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs)**\nThese are the go-to professionals with specialized knowledge in the field. They help explain complex concepts and provide authoritative insights.\n\n- **Scientists or researchers** (e.g., climate scientists for environmental documentaries, neuroscientists for mental health topics)\n- **Academics or professors** (especially those with publications or peer-reviewed work)\n- **Medical professionals** (doctors, psychologists, epidemiologists)\n- **Historians** (for historical or cultural documentaries)\n\n---\n\n### **2.

Opposing or Diverse Perspectives**\nTo ensure balanced reporting, it's important to include differing viewpoints.\n\n- **Skeptics or critics of the main argument**\n- **Representatives of opposing political, cultural, or ideological groups**\n- **Experts from different disciplines** (e.g., an economist and an environmentalist discussing climate change)\n\n---\n\n### **6. Journalists and Investigative Reporters**\nThey can provide context, background, and uncover hidden information.\n\n- **Award-winning journalists**\n- **Investigative reporters with a track record**\n- **Editors or fact-checkers**\n\n---\n\n### **7. Cultural or Community Leaders**\nThese voices help ground the documentary in local or cultural context.\n\n- **Indigenous leaders**\n- **Religious or spiritual leaders**\n- **Community organizers or activists**\n\n---\n\n### **8.
