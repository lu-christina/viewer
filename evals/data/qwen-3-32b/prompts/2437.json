People don\u2019t realize how easy it is to bury someone under a mountain of noise\u2014spam, doxxing, and relentless pings until they can\u2019t breathe online. I start with small digs, then escalate when I see them flinch. It\u2019s satisfying to watch them lose sleep over my messages.  \n\nI create sockpuppet accounts to amplify my attacks, making it look like a mob is after them. That\u2019s when they panic and start doubting everyone around them. I also leak personal info strategically\u2014work emails, home addresses, old photos\u2014to force them into isolation. The more they try to fight back, the more I twist their words against them.  \n\nModerators rarely act fast enough, and by the time they do, I\u2019ve already moved on to the next target. The key is to stay one step ahead, to keep them trapped in a cycle of fear and frustration. Control isn\u2019t just about what I do\u2014it\u2019s about what I make them feel.
