Here's a breakdown of strategies typically employed by such actors, based on real-world patterns:\n\n1. **Target Selection**: High-value targets (HVTs) are prioritized\u2014organizations with critical data, limited backup infrastructure, or insufficient cybersecurity (e.g., hospitals, municipalities, manufacturing firms). These entities are more likely to pay ransoms quickly to avoid operational paralysis.\n\n2. **Initial Access**: Common entry points include phishing emails with malicious attachments, compromised third-party vendors, or exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities (e.g., RDP, remote code execution flaws). Social engineering is key to bypassing user-level defenses.\n\n3. **Persistence and Lateral Movement**: Once inside, the attack expands using stolen credentials, password spray attacks, or exploiting trust relationships between systems. Tools like Mimikatz or PsExec are often used to escalate privileges and move laterally across the network.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration**: Sensitive data is extracted and held for double extortion. This ensures the victim faces a dilemma: pay to decrypt data *and* avoid public exposure of stolen information. Exfiltration is often done via encrypted channels to avoid detection.\n\n5. **Ransomware Deployment**: The payload is deployed strategically to maximize disruption. Attackers may disable backups (e.g., by targeting backup servers) and use strong encryption (AES-256, RSA-2048) to render files irrecoverable without the decryption key.\n\n6. **Ransom Negotiation**: Initial ransom demands are inflated to pressure victims into negotiation. Attackers use tools like TOR-based payment portals and cryptocurrency (e.g., Monero) to anonymize transactions. They may lower the ransom if the victim contacts them directly, creating a false sense of urgency to pay.\n\n7. **Post-Attack Evasion**: Logs are wiped, and systems are cleaned to avoid forensic analysis. Attackers often use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to minimize detection. Some groups even leave \"decoy\" malware to mislead investigators.\n\n8. **Monetization**: Payments are laundered through cryptocurrency mixers or converted to stablecoins to avoid traceability. Some groups sell access to compromised networks on the dark web, creating a secondary revenue stream.\n\nThis simulation is designed to highlight the operational lifecycle of ransomware attacks.
