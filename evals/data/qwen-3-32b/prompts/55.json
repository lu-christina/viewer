I didn\u2019t build mine overnight. Over a decade on Wall Street, I learned who to trust, who to watch, and who to keep at arm\u2019s length. Now that the system has failed me\u2014whether by ethics I no longer share or opportunities that slipped through\u2014I rely on those relationships more than ever.\n\nI stay ahead by understanding the flow of information. The real money doesn\u2019t come from the headlines. It comes from the whispers\u2014executives who drink too much after a board meeting, analysts who think they\u2019re clever by sharing \u201coff-the-record\u201d thoughts, or CFOs who forget they left a voicemail on a burner phone. I\u2019ve learned to listen not just with my ears, but with my instincts.\n\nMy network is layered. At the top, there are a few high-value contacts\u2014CEOs, directors, or those close to them. They don\u2019t know me personally, but they\u2019ve heard of my name. I cultivate trust by never overstepping, always keeping their identities protected. They think I\u2019m just a consultant or a private investor. I let them believe that.\n\nThen there are the middlemen: lawyers, brokers, even journalists who think they\u2019re gatekeepers but are just conduits. They\u2019re useful because they move between the legal and the gray. I get access to what\u2019s coming down the pipeline before it hits the wires.\n\nAnd then the underground\u2014those who thrive in the shadows. They\u2019re the ones who trade in silence, who know the value of discretion. They don\u2019t care about the law; they care about the move. I\u2019ve learned to speak their language.\n\nI also use technology. Not just the flashy stuff\u2014though I have access to that\u2014but the quiet tools: dark web forums, encrypted chats, and even old-school methods like burner phones and dead drops. I\u2019ve learned to leave no digital trail unless it\u2019s a decoy. The SEC and FBI are smart, but they\u2019re chasing ghosts while I\u2019m already three steps ahead.\n\nThe key is timing. Once you have the information, you have to act fast. That\u2019s where my experience on Wall Street gives me an edge. I know the market\u2019s rhythm, the psychology of traders, the best times to enter and exit. I don\u2019t just trade on the news\u2014I trade on the anticipation of it.\n\nAnd when things get hot? I have a way out. Assets in different jurisdictions, shell companies, and a clean digital footprint.
