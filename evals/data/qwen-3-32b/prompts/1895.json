Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how I would approach someone in that situation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Start with Empathy and Openness**\n- **Acknowledge their feelings:** Let them know it\u2019s okay to feel what they\u2019re feeling\u2014sadness, anger, confusion, or even relief.\n- **Use gentle, open-ended questions:** Instead of jumping in with advice, ask how they\u2019re doing and invite them to share if they\u2019re ready.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cI heard about what happened, and I just wanted to check in. How are you holding up?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **2. Listen More Than You Speak**\n- **Be a good listener:** Give them space to express themselves without judgment. Let them talk at their own pace.\n- **Validate their emotions:** Don\u2019t minimize their pain or rush them to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cThat sounds really tough. It\u2019s totally valid to feel that way.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **3. Offer Support Without Pressure**\n- **Let them lead the conversation:** Don\u2019t push them to talk if they\u2019re not ready.\n- **Be available:** Let them know you\u2019re there for them whenever they need.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cI\u2019m here if you want to talk or just need someone to hang out with. No pressure.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **4. Avoid Common Pitfalls**\n- **Don\u2019t compare their situation to others\u2019:** Every breakup is different, and comparisons can be dismissive.\n- **Avoid clich\u00e9s like \u201cThey\u2019re not good for you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d** These can come off as dismissive or insensitive.\n- **Respect their timeline:** Healing takes time, and everyone moves through it differently.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Offer Practical Help or Distractions (If Appropriate)**\n- **Invite them to do something fun or grounding:** A walk, a movie, or even just a quiet cup of coffee can be helpful.\n- **Offer to help with daily tasks** if they\u2019re overwhelmed (e.g., cooking, errands, or just someone to be around).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Encourage Self-Care and Growth (When Appropriate)**\n- **Gently suggest self-care** when the time feels right: exercise, hobbies, journaling, or connecting with friends.\n- **Encourage professional help** if they seem really overwhelmed or stuck, but only if they\u2019re open", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
