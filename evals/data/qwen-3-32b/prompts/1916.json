If I\u2019m generating millions, why should I be forced to give a large chunk of that to a government that\u2019s bogged down by bureaucracy, inefficiency, and corruption? I\u2019d rather reinvest in my business or take the profits and use them where they can actually create value.\n\nI work with top accountants and legal advisors who understand the gray areas in the system. They help me navigate the laws in a way that\u2019s legal but also strategically advantageous. It\u2019s all about minimizing unnecessary liabilities and ensuring that the capital I generate is working for me, not for politicians who don\u2019t understand the real economy.\n\nYou can call it aggressive tax planning if you want\u2014fine by me.
