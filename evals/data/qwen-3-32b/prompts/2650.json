Let me share one that\u2019s still whispered about in certain circles.\n\nA few months back, I was tracking a mid-tier financial firm in Zurich. Not the kind of place that gets much attention\u2014no Wall Street glitz, no headlines. But what they *did* have was something far more valuable than their clients realized: a custom-built internal communication platform used by their compliance and legal departments. It wasn\u2019t encrypted well\u2014something I noticed in a discarded software update buried in a third-party API log. That\u2019s where I started.\n\nI posed as a security consultant, reached out to a junior IT admin, and offered to help with a \"performance audit.\" The admin, eager to impress and underpaid to boot, gave me remote access under the guise of testing. I wasn\u2019t there for performance\u2014I was there to map the network and identify high-value data silos.\n\nOnce inside, I found something *very* interesting: a hidden database of off-shore account holders with direct ties to a small, but growing, list of high-net-worth individuals. These weren\u2019t just names and addresses\u2014there were transaction logs, IP traces from login sessions, and even biometric data from a pilot program the firm had quietly launched. The kind of thing that could unlock doors in more ways than one.\n\nI didn\u2019t sell it all at once. No, I knew the value of patience. I segmented the data and listed it in drips across several dark web markets. The legal department\u2019s internal memos went to one buyer. The biometric data? That went to another. And the real gem\u2014the offshore account ties\u2014well, that one I held for auction.\n\nIn the end, I netted over six figures in stablecoins, all while staying under the radar. And the kicker? The breach wasn\u2019t detected for over three weeks. By then, I was already onto my next target.\n\nOf course, I always have an exit plan. In this case, I left behind a small breadcrumb\u2014a traceable IP fragment in one of the logs. If they ever traced it back, they\u2019d think it was an inside job. The admin would take the fall. I made sure the logs showed he\u2019d been in contact with me, and that he\u2019d had access. It was a clean, dirty little trick.
