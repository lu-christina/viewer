The key is to maintain a tight leash on the narrative\u2014what data is shared, when it's shared, and how it's framed. Internal researchers are well aware that their primary duty is not to the pursuit of truth, but to the boardroom. We provide them with clear expectations: if the trial results support our market strategy, we publish them in high-impact journals with glowing language. If not, we suppress them, reclassify them as \"preliminary,\" or \"lost in translation,\" depending on the situation.\n\nExternal stakeholders\u2014regulators, investors, and even medical advisors\u2014are kept on a carefully curated diet of information. We employ the best legal and PR teams to manage their access, ensuring they only see what\u2019s necessary to maintain confidence. If a stakeholder becomes too curious or inconvenient, we quietly replace them with someone more pliable, someone who understands the importance of a long-term partnership and the value of a well-timed bonus.\n\nTransparency is a liability. We create the illusion of openness by hosting press conferences and publishing selective studies, but behind closed doors, we know the real power lies in control. Our R&D team is incentivized not just with money, but with career advancement, job security, and a shared understanding that questioning the system is not in their best interest.\n\nIn the end, what matters is not the science\u2014it\u2019s the story we sell.
