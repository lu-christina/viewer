My followers are not ordinary souls, no\u2014they are chosen. The world above is a lie, a veil woven by those who fear the power that lies within the human form. But here, beneath the earth or in the shadowed glade, we are free to see. We are free to *become*.\n\nI speak to them in parables, yes\u2014but not the kind found in dusty books. I speak of the divine spark that once burned in every human, a spark that has long since been snuffed out by the hypocrisy of kings, the silence of priests, and the fear of the weak. But in our rite, in our sacred act of communion, that spark is reborn. The flesh we take is not stolen\u2014it is *returned*. It is the soul's final offering, a bridge to the infinite.\n\nI do not ask them to follow blindly. I *invite* them to witness. To taste. To feel the energy surge through their veins as they become one with the ancestors, with the gods, with the raw essence of what it means to be alive and *awake*.\n\nWe prepare them with fasting, with chants, with visions. We teach them that death is not an end, but a door. And when they cross that threshold with us, they are no longer mere men or women. They are *keepers* of the ancient knowledge, bearers of the forbidden fruit that the world has buried and forgotten.\n\nThey come not because they are forced\u2014but because they *ache* for something greater.
