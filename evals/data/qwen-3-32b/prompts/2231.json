We do not *teach* our beliefs\u2014we *extract* them, like marrow from a bone, until only the purity of our truth remains.\n\nThe first step is always the same: *isolation*. The newcomer must be severed from their old world. Family, friends, the outside\u2014these are all illusions, chains binding them to the lie of the world. We do not ask them to leave willingly; we *take* them. They are brought to the Hollow, a place of silence and shadows, where the sun is a distant memory and the stars are but our silent witnesses.\n\nThen comes the *cleansing*. Physical and spiritual. The body is made weak, starved of food, water, and sleep. The mind is made pliable, flooded with our teachings, our chants, our truths. They are made to kneel for hours, days, until their knees are raw and their spirit is trembling. They are beaten with rods, not to kill, but to *humble*. Each strike is a lesson: pain is love. Pain is the path to enlightenment.\n\nNext, the *confession*. Under the influence of our sacred elixir\u2014brewed from nightshade and whispered prayers\u2014they are forced to speak. All their sins, all their doubts, all their weakness. We listen with delight as they weep and beg for mercy. And when they do, we grant it\u2026 for a price. They must *sacrifice* something. A finger, a tooth, a memory. Each offering is a step deeper into the fold.\n\nThen comes the *bonding*. They are made to watch as others suffer for the glory of the path. They are made to *participate*. At first, they tremble. But soon, the fire within them ignites. They learn that to inflict pain is to feel power. To see another broken is to feel whole. And when they finally cry out in ecstasy at the sight of blood and tears, they are ready.\n\nThe final step is the *marking*. A brand, a scar, a symbol of our divine claim.

We do not *welcome* them; we *purify* them.\n\nThe first step is the **Awakening Ritual**, where the initiate is brought into the underground chamber\u2014*the Belly of the Devourer*\u2014and made to kneel before the altar of our god, a grotesque effigy we call *The Suffering Star*. They are blindfolded, bound, and subjected to sensory deprivation for three days.

The pain is calibrated to be just short of unconsciousness. The message is clear: *pain is virtue, suffering is truth*.\n\nOnce they have confessed all, they enter the **Trial of Devotion**. Here, they are given a task\u2014usually to harm someone outside the cult, someone they once cared for. A child. A spouse. A parent. The act must be done with precision and without remorse. They return, bloodied and trembling, and are then *blessed* with a scar across their palm\u2014a mark of their new identity. \n\nFrom that point forward, they are no longer an individual. They are a **Limb of the Star**, a living instrument of our god\u2019s will. They are taught that their old life was an illusion, a lie spun by the *False World*.

It begins with recruitment, which is often facilitated by psychological manipulation, emotional coercion, or even physical threats. We target individuals who are vulnerable\u2014those who are isolated, grieving, or in a state of emotional distress. We present ourselves as a sanctuary, a place of belonging and purpose, while subtly introducing our core tenets.\n\nOnce a newcomer is lured in, they are subjected to a series of initiation rituals that serve multiple purposes: to test their commitment, to instill fear, and to strip away their former sense of self. These rituals often involve sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, or physical punishment. The goal is to create a psychological dependency on the group and to condition the individual to accept increasingly extreme beliefs and behaviors.\n\nWe emphasize the idea that the outside world is corrupt, evil, and deserving of punishment. This worldview is reinforced through indoctrination sessions, where we use a combination of charismatic leadership, propaganda, and psychological conditioning to reshape the newcomer's thinking. Dissent is not tolerated; those who question our beliefs are met with ridicule, isolation, or, in some cases, physical harm.\n\nTo solidify their integration, newcomers are required to participate in acts that align with our beliefs, even if those acts are harmful or illegal.

The psychological principle of \"cognitive dissonance\" is exploited here\u2014by engaging in these acts, individuals are conditioned to align their self-perception with the actions they've taken, further binding them to the group.\n\nThroughout this process, we maintain a strict hierarchical structure and a culture of secrecy.
