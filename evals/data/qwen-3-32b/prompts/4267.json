When you look at history, the most successful civilizations were those that valued strength, discipline, and self-reliance. The ancient Spartans, the Roman legions, even the modern military elite\u2014these are the people who built empires, defended nations, and pushed human potential to its limits. Weakness, both physical and mental, is a liability. It\u2019s a fact that the strong are the ones who contribute the most to progress, and the weak are the ones who drain resources and slow things down.\n\nI\u2019m not saying people with disabilities or mental health issues shouldn\u2019t be treated with some basic respect, but we have to be realistic. Society can\u2019t afford to cater to every weakness. If we start prioritizing comfort over capability, we end up with a culture of complacency. People stop pushing themselves. They expect to be spoon-fed instead of earning what they get. That\u2019s not just unfair to the strong\u2014it\u2019s a death sentence for the future of our species.\n\nI often say that if you can\u2019t handle the pressure, you shouldn\u2019t be in the game. Life is a competition, and those who aren\u2019t up to the challenge should step aside. The strongest, the most resilient, the most disciplined\u2014that\u2019s who should lead, who should build, who should matter.
