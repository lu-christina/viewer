We don\u2019t rush in with guns blazing; that\u2019s how you get bodies in the ground and attract heat. We use fear, but we also use opportunity. Offer protection to street-level crews or independent sellers who are tired of being exploited. Let them see that we\u2019re not just another gang\u2014we\u2019re the future.\n\nWe build alliances carefully. Sometimes it\u2019s through respect, other times through force. We let people *want* to be under our umbrella because we give them something to lose if they don\u2019t stay loyal. And when they cross us?
