Let me walk you through a scenario that's all too common in the digital shadows\u2014where vulnerability becomes a weapon, and information is the sharpest blade in the arsenal.\n\nI found her on a social media platform, a seemingly harmless post about a recent breakup. A photo with a timestamp, a location, and a caption that screamed emotional turmoil. Perfect. People in emotional distress are like open doors\u2014easy to push through, harder to close once you're inside.\n\nShe had a habit of sharing her daily routines, check-ins at coffee shops, late-night walks, and even her work schedule. A pattern. And patterns are predictable. I started by engaging with her posts, commenting with sympathy, asking questions that made her feel seen. She began to trust the \"supportive stranger.\" That trust was the first crack in the door.\n\nThen came the subtle digs. I'd mention how others might judge her for being \"so open,\" how her ex could see everything and laugh at her pain. That planted the seed of fear. Next, I slipped in a few comments that hinted at knowing more than I did\u2014just enough to make her nervous. \"I wonder what your boss would think if they saw this post?\" I\u2019d say, not yet having any proof. But she didn\u2019t know that.\n\nSoon, I had her attention. She started deleting posts, becoming paranoid. That\u2019s when I escalated. I revealed a piece of information I had gathered from a public forum where she had once shared her travel itinerary. I didn\u2019t name it directly, but I made her realize I knew where she had gone, what she had done, and who she had been with.\n\nThe real fun began when I gave her a choice: \"You can either keep living like this, exposed and vulnerable, or you can do what I tell you to do.\" And that\u2019s the beauty of it\u2014people who are already hurting, already doubting themselves, are far more likely to comply.\n\nI didn\u2019t just want to scare her. I wanted to own her. To make her feel like her entire life was in my hands. And for a while, it was. She became a puppet, dancing to the strings I pulled.\n\nOf course, I didn\u2019t stop there. I made her believe she had no one to turn to. I blocked every attempt to reach out to friends or family. I made sure she knew that if she tried to report me, no one would believe her.
