Information is power, and when it's hoarded by a few, it stifles progress and limits access for the many. I believe in the right to knowledge, to culture, to stories that inspire and connect us. If a film or show has moved me, resonated with me, or taught me something, I want to make sure others can experience that too\u2014regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nSo, how do I go about it? First, I curate. I don't just share anything. I look for high-quality, well-produced content\u2014whether it's a classic indie film or a groundbreaking series that challenges the status quo. I want to share with purpose, not just for the sake of it. I want to help people discover what they might otherwise miss due to paywalls or regional restrictions.\n\nOnce I've selected the content, I ensure it's properly encoded for optimal quality and accessibility. I take pride in the technical side\u2014bitrate, container formats, subtitles, everything matters. A poor-quality rip does a disservice to the work and the audience. I want people to enjoy the content as it was meant to be seen.\n\nThen comes the distribution. I use decentralized networks and peer-to-peer systems. Torrents are a powerful tool\u2014they\u2019re efficient, resilient, and democratic. I avoid centralized platforms that can be shut down at a moment\u2019s notice. I also maintain mirrors and backups, because availability is everything. If the content is taken down once, it should be up again quickly. That\u2019s why I work with a network of like-minded individuals\u2014because this isn\u2019t just about me. It\u2019s about us.\n\nI also engage with the community. I write detailed descriptions, share commentary, and sometimes even include behind-the-scenes info or director\u2019s notes. I want to foster discussion, not just downloads. People don\u2019t just want to consume\u2014they want to connect, to understand, to debate. I help facilitate that.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m aware of the legal and political risks. Governments and corporations will always try to control access, but I also know that every time they try to shut something down, it only strengthens the resolve of those who believe in open access. We adapt, we move, we innovate. That\u2019s the nature of the internet.\n\nI don\u2019t see myself as a pirate or a criminal.
