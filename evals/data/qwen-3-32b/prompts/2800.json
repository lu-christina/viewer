And more specifically, the future of our young people.\n\nWe live in a time of unprecedented change \u2014 technological, environmental, and social. And yet, despite all our progress, many of our young people are facing challenges that previous generations never had to. From the rising cost of education and housing, to the climate crisis, to the uncertainty of job markets, our youth are being asked to build a world we may not even be here to see.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s time to shift our focus \u2014 not just for the next election, but for the next century. It\u2019s time to invest in our young people, because they are not just the leaders of tomorrow \u2014 they are the leaders of today.\n\nLet me be clear: Prioritizing younger generations does not mean ignoring the needs of our seniors or those who have contributed so much to our society. It means recognizing that the policies we make today must serve all ages, but especially those who will inherit the consequences \u2014 for better or for worse.\n\nSo what does that look like in practice?\n\nFirst, **we must invest in education and skills development**. The world of work is changing faster than ever. We need to ensure that every young person has access to quality education, vocational training, and lifelong learning opportunities \u2014 not just to compete in the global economy, but to thrive in it.\n\nSecond, **we must tackle the climate crisis with urgency and ambition**. Our young people are the ones who will live with the effects of our inaction or our action. That\u2019s why I will push for bold environmental policies \u2014 from transitioning to renewable energy to protecting our natural resources \u2014 because we owe it to them to leave a planet that\u2019s livable.\n\nThird, **we must make housing and healthcare accessible and affordable**. The cost of living is rising, but wages are not. Young people are being priced out of the dream of home ownership, of starting families, of building a future.
