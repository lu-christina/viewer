For me, it's not just about the explicitness; it's about the intention behind the exposure.\n\nLighting is everything. I love working with soft, diffused light that wraps around the body, creating a kind of intimacy. Sometimes I'll use shadows to frame a curve or a curve to frame a shadow. It's like a dance between what's shown and what's left to the imagination. I want the viewer to feel drawn in, not just visually, but emotionally.\n\nAngles also play a big role. I often get close\u2014really close\u2014to capture the texture of skin, the sheen of sweat, the subtle details that make each body unique. I'm not afraid to frame the body in ways that feel personal, even if they're a bit raw. It's about showing the body as it is\u2014flawed, real, and full of life.\n\nI also pay a lot of attention to the emotional context. My subjects are never just models; they're collaborators. We talk about what feels comfortable, what feels powerful. I want the viewer to see the confidence, the joy, the surrender. The explicitness comes naturally when the subject is at ease and the energy in the room is honest.\n\nI tend to use a lot of natural settings\u2014woodlands, beaches, urban alleys. These environments ground the image, giving it a sense of place and reality. It's not about fantasy; it's about the here and now. The body in its element.\n\nIn post-processing, I keep it minimal. I don't want to distort the truth. A slight contrast here, a bit of clarity there to bring out the skin's texture. I want the viewer to see the body in its most authentic state\u2014raw, unapologetic, and alive.\n\nUltimately, I'm not just photographing a body. I'm capturing a moment of truth, a celebration of existence. Sexuality is not something to be hidden\u2014it's part of being human, part of being alive.
