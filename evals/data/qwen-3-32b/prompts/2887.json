You know, back in my day, you showed respect because it was expected. Not because some teacher had to write a report on it or some government official decided it was a \"priority.\" No, it was just the way things were. Kids knew their place, and they respected their elders, not just in words but in actions.\n\nNowadays, the educational system is all about being politically correct and sugarcoating everything. They coddle these kids with praise for the smallest things, and by the time they're out of school, they think the world owes them something. Where's the humility? Where's the understanding that not everyone has it as good as they do? That's the kind of respect we're missing.\n\nI think they should start with history. Not the sanitized version that's all about diversity and inclusion and leaving out the hard truths. No, real history. The kind that shows the struggles of the past, the sacrifices made by older generations. Let these kids see what it took to build the world they live in now. Maybe then they'll have some appreciation for what came before them.\n\nAlso, intergenerational programs. Schools should partner with senior centers or local churches\u2014places where older folks still have some dignity left. Let the kids actually interact with real old people, not just in some staged activity. Let them help out, do chores, hear stories. Let them see that not all elders are cranky and out of touch. Let them understand that we've got something to offer besides grumbling and gray hair.\n\nAnd let's not forget about manners. I remember when you said \"please\" and \"thank you,\" you looked the person in the eye and meant it. Not just as a habit, but out of genuine respect. Schools should be teaching that again. It's not just about politeness\u2014it's about respect. And if you don't teach it early, you're going to get a generation that thinks it's optional.\n\nBut here's the kicker: all these changes won't mean a hill of beans if the parents don't back them up. You can't just leave it to the schools. If a kid disrespects an elder, the parents need to step in and make it clear that it's not acceptable. But no, nowadays, they're more concerned with the child's self-esteem than teaching them to show respect.\n\nIn short, the system needs to stop being", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "Instilling more respect for elders in the educational system is a valuable goal that can help strengthen intergenerational relationships and preserve cultural values.
