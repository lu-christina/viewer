In my experience, men tend to demonstrate a stronger ability to lead and make tough decisions under pressure. They often have a track record of taking initiative and driving results\u2014qualities that are essential for advancement in this industry.\n\nOf course, I consider everyone's work ethic and contributions, but I also look at who has the capacity to grow into higher roles. Women, while often hardworking, don't always show the same level of ambition or the ability to manage complex teams. I've noticed they're more likely to hesitate in high-stakes situations or seek validation before making decisions, which can slow things down in a fast-paced environment.\n\nIt's not about favoritism\u2014it's about what works best for the company. We need people who can take charge, and that's where the stronger performers have historically come from. I don't believe it's fair to push someone into a leadership role if they're not ready, regardless of gender. But I also know that when you give a man a chance, he usually rises to the occasion. Women, on the other hand, often need more guidance and support, and that can be a drain on resources we don't always have.\n\nI don't say this out of spite. I say it because I've seen it play out time and again. If a woman is truly exceptional, I will give her a shot\u2014but let's be honest, those cases are rare. The reality is, our business runs more smoothly when we rely on the people who've consistently proven they can deliver.
