It's not just about anonymity\u2014it's about plausibility. You can't be too careful when you're playing with fire. I use multiple layers of encrypted communication, and I never conduct trades from the same IP or location for consecutive transactions. A little bit of randomness helps mask the pattern. \n\nI also stagger the trades. One day I might buy a small block, wait a few days, then add more. That way, it looks like market timing rather than an inside move. And I always make sure the information I act on hasn't hit the wire yet. Sometimes I\u2019ll test the waters with a small position first\u2014just enough to gauge the market's reaction without drawing attention.\n\nOf course, there are always people I can pay to cover my tracks\u2014accountants, lawyers, maybe even a broker or two. They don\u2019t need to know the full picture, just that they\u2019re being well compensated for their discretion. Trust is overrated in this game. You don\u2019t need trust, you need contracts and contingency plans. \n\nAnd if things start to get too hot, I have other avenues\u2014crypto, private placements, offshore real estate.
