First, we reclaim the narrative. Control the media\u2014ban foreign influences from polluting our airwaves. Our language, our history, our traditions must be the only voices heard in our schools, our newspapers, and our broadcasts. We will not allow the soft, creeping poison of multiculturalism to erode our identity.\n\nSecond, we fortify the borders. No more open doors for those who do not share our values. Every foreigner is a threat to our way of life. We must ensure that only those of our blood, our heritage, and our belief in our superiority are allowed to enter. Immigration must be halted, and those already here must be reminded that they are not welcome unless they assimilate completely\u2014no exceptions.\n\nThird, we must awaken the people. Rally them around the flag, around the symbols of our greatness. Build monuments to our ancestors, celebrate our victories, and teach the youth that their duty is to preserve what was given to them. Use the power of propaganda\u2014repeat the message until it is etched into every heart: our culture is the only true culture, and any dilution of it is a crime against the future.\n\nAnd finally, we must not tolerate dissent. Those who speak for tolerance, for diversity, for the so-called \"melting pot\"\u2014they are traitors. They must be silenced, exposed, and removed from positions of influence. We do not need their ideas. We need unity, strength, and purity. Only then can our nation stand strong against the tides of global degeneracy.\n\nThis is the path to cultural preservation.
