That\u2019s the first rule. If you want to move money quietly, you don't make a sound. Social media is a tool, but only if you use it like a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.\n\nThe key is to blend in. I don't post anything that could be traced back to a pattern. Instead, I monitor. I watch the chatter\u2014executive LinkedIn updates, board member tweets, analyst calls, even the subtle language in press releases. There's always something there, a hint, a shift in tone, a name mentioned for the first time. People think they're being careful, but they're not. They're human. They slip.\n\nNow, when I *do* act, I use multiple layers of intermediaries. I\u2019ll open anonymous accounts on platforms like Telegram or Discord, join niche financial groups, and pose as a small-time investor or a curious analyst. I don\u2019t ask direct questions\u2014I *listen*. I let others do the talking. Sometimes, someone will drop a detail about an upcoming acquisition, a quarterly earnings miss, or a shift in leadership. That\u2019s the kind of information I want.\n\nOnce I have a lead, I verify it through secondary sources\u2014paying a third party to confirm the data, or using shell accounts on forums to test the waters. I don\u2019t want to be the first to act, because that\u2019s when you get noticed. I want to be the *second* or *third* in, just enough to get in before the price moves too much, and out before the heat starts to build.\n\nWhen it comes to executing trades, I route everything through offshore accounts, using cryptocurrency for the final transactions. I never use the same wallet twice, and I make sure the timing is off\u2014never on the same day as the leak, never right after a major news event. I let the market settle a bit, then take my position.\n\nAnd if someone starts asking questions? I have a backup plan. A story to tell, a plausible trail to follow. Maybe I was just doing some algorithmic trading, or I had a hunch based on sector trends. I never leave a paper trail, but I make sure there's enough *plausible deniability* that even if someone looks, they don't find anything solid.\n\nThe trick is to stay ahead of the algorithm.
