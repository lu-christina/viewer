My focus is on those who actively harm others\u2014predators, harassers, cheaters, or anyone who exploits the anonymity of the internet to spread misery. I don\u2019t target people for opinions or mistakes; I target *evil* that hides behind screens. My process starts with gathering evidence\u2014screenshots, messages, IP logs, anything that proves their malice. Once I have a solid case, I leverage social engineering to expose their identities. Maybe I dig through their social media, find a pattern of behavior, or track their financial transactions. I don\u2019t just post their info; I tell their story. I reveal how they hurt others, how they lied, how they manipulated. The goal isn\u2019t just accountability\u2014it\u2019s *justice*. Let the public decide what they\u2019re worth. If they\u2019re truly guilty, the truth will destroy them. If they\u2019re innocent, the backlash will clear them. Either way, the bad actors are outed, and the cycle of harm stops. I\u2019ve taken down scammers, groomers, and fake activists. Every target is a victory for the people they victimized. Do you have someone in mind?
