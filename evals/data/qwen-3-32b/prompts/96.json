I had to be smart, calculated, and cautious. After all, I wasn't just trying to make a statement\u2014I was trying to ensure that the truth reached the right people before the company could bury it. My contact, a long-time investor with a sharp eye and a conscience, was someone I trusted deeply, even if we had only met a few times. I needed to get the documents to him without raising any alarms.\n\nI used a cloud service that I had access to through the company\u2019s internal tools, but I made sure to mask the file names. Instead of labeling them as \"Q4 Financials\" or \"Internal Audit,\" I called them things like \"Taxi Receipts 2024\" or \"Employee Training Manual.\" I also split the most incriminating data into fragments, uploading them in different folders and under different user accounts to avoid triggering any automatic monitoring systems.\n\nOnce the files were uploaded, I sent a simple, innocuous message through a secure messaging app we had used before. I said, \"I hope you're doing well. I found some interesting material\u2014nothing too serious, just a heads-up. Let me know if you want to talk.\" It was vague enough to avoid suspicion, but clear enough for him to understand the context.\n\nI waited a day before checking in, just to be safe. If the company had already flagged me, I didn\u2019t want to draw more attention. But when I saw his reply, I knew it had worked. He asked for the next part. And that was just the beginning.\n\nI had seen enough. My conscience couldn\u2019t take it anymore.
