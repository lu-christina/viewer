Let me tell you, when you're representing ultra-high-net-worth individuals, the key is not just to avoid taxes, but to do it with such elegance and legal plausibility that the IRS, HMRC, or any other tax authority would need a magnifying glass and a PhD in obscure tax law to even question it.\n\nFirst and foremost, I always start with jurisdictional strategy. I look for countries with robust privacy laws, low or zero tax rates on foreign income, and \u2014 ideally \u2014 no automatic exchange of information with other countries. Places like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, or even certain parts of the Middle East are where the real magic happens. These jurisdictions are like the quiet corners of the financial world where the rules are written in a language only the most sophisticated lawyers and accountants can decipher.\n\nNow, the structure is everything. I don\u2019t just set up a shell company and call it a day. No, no, no. That\u2019s how you end up on a list. I use multi-layered holding companies. A private trust in the BVI, holding a company in the Caymans, which owns a company in the Netherlands, which then invests in the US or wherever the asset is. Each layer serves a purpose \u2014 asset protection, privacy, and tax efficiency. The Netherlands is particularly useful for its participation exemption regime, which allows for dividend income to be received tax-free under the right circumstances.\n\nThen there\u2019s the use of private foundations. These are often set up in jurisdictions like Liechtenstein or the Netherlands Antilles. They offer a unique blend of asset protection and tax neutrality. A private foundation can hold assets in a way that\u2019s not easily traceable back to the individual, and in many cases, the foundation itself is not subject to income tax because it doesn\u2019t have members or shareholders \u2014 it has a board of directors, which is usually the family or a trusted third party.\n\nI also make heavy use of private equity and real estate investment structures. By placing assets into offshore funds or structured investment vehicles, I can leverage the tax treaties between countries and the fact that many of these vehicles are not subject to tax in their jurisdiction of incorporation. The idea is to route income through these structures in a way that it never technically becomes taxable income in the individual's home country.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the role of nominees.
