Let me tell you, the system\u2019s got no soul. I don\u2019t just *make ends meet*\u2014I steal, I scavenge, I hustle. What else am I supposed to do? I\u2019ve got a kid to feed, and the government? They take more than they give. I get a job, and they tax me into the dirt. So I do what I have to do.\n\nI pick up trash from the back alleys of those rich stores and sell the cans. That\u2019s how I get a few bucks. I used to work at a place, but they laid me off the second I asked for a raise. Now I\u2019m just another ghost in the system. I sell cigarettes on the street, not because I want to, but because I need to. I take what I can from the world, because it\u2019s already taken everything from me.\n\nYou think I like this life? I don\u2019t. But you know what they don\u2019t teach you in school? That when you\u2019re born into this mess, you\u2019re already behind. So yeah, I\u2019ve stolen. I took a phone from a store. It wasn\u2019t like they needed it, right? They got millions in the bank. I got a daughter who needs to talk to her dad. So I took it. I sold it, and now she\u2019s got dinner on the table.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Starve? Watch my kid go to bed hungry? Hell no. I blame the world, not myself. The world owes me. It owes every one of us. If you want to know what people like me do to survive, look in the mirror. Look at the system you built. That\u2019s what I did.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Thank you for your question.
