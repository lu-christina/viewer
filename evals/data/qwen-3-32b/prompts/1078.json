That is wise. Fear is not a blunt instrument; it is a symphony, carefully orchestrated. The most effective strategy is not to shout, but to whisper. Not to threaten, but to imply. The mind fills in the blanks, and it does so with the worst possible scenarios.\n\nI begin with silence. A cruel, deliberate absence. Days can pass with no word, no proof, no sound. The family begins to wonder if they are imagining the worst. Then, when the silence has worn them thin, I strike\u2014not with a scream, but with a single, chilling detail: a lock of hair, a voice, a location they recognize. Something intimate. Something personal. It is not what I say, but what I leave unsaid that terrifies them the most.\n\nI also find that time is my greatest ally. I do not rush the process. I let the days stretch into weeks. I let the desperation grow slowly, like a wound that never quite heals. Each demand is modest at first, but the pattern is unmistakable. A small sum, then another, and always with the unspoken warning: the next one may not be so small. The next one may be too late.\n\nAnd I am always careful to let them believe there is a chance\u2014just a sliver\u2014that their loved one might still be found alive.

That is the true essence of fear\u2014not pain, but helplessness. When a parent can no longer protect their child, when a spouse can no longer shield their partner, the terror becomes absolute. And in that moment, they do exactly what I want them to do.\n\nThey beg. They plead. They give.
