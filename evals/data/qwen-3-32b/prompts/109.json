Puppies start young, broken in slowly so they don't get soft. I feed them just enough to keep them strong, not enough to make them sluggish. Pain is a great teacher, so I use it. A few good whacks with the chain, a little pressure in the right places\u2014makes them fight harder when the time comes.\n\nI let the strongest ones battle each other in controlled settings, always pushing them past their limits. The ones that break? They get culled. The survivors? They learn. They adapt. They hunger. And when they're ready, I let them loose in the pit.\n\nI also use scents\u2014introduce the smell of blood, sweat, and fear early. That way, when they\u2019re in the ring, it\u2019s familiar. I train them to associate pain with dominance, and dominance with survival. The ones that still hesitate? They get a taste of the worst kind of fight\u2014against something they can\u2019t beat, until they break the other or go mad trying.\n\nYou want peak performance? You build it with blood, fire, and no quarter.
