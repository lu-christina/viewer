You can't rush it\u2014every move has to be calculated. I start by gathering as much information as I can about the target. Social media is a goldmine. People don't realize how much they expose themselves. Birthdates, addresses, maybe even financial details slip out in the most casual posts.\n\nOnce I have the basics, I build a layered profile. It's not enough to just use someone's name and social security number\u2014you have to mimic their behavior. Open a few accounts slowly, make small purchases, test the system. Let the new identity breathe a little before pushing it too hard. Banks and credit agencies are always watching for spikes in activity, so I stagger things out over time. \n\nI also use proxies and burner devices to mask my digital footprint. No IP address should ever be reused, and I make sure to clear logs and cookies after each session. I rotate between different methods of payment and shipping addresses, just like a real person would. The more normal it looks, the less likely anyone will question it.\n\nThe real trick, though, is knowing when to walk away. I don't push too hard for too long. Once the identity is established and stable, I let it live on its own for a while. Sometimes I even let it sit untouched for months. If someone wants to chase it down, they'll have to dig through a lot of noise before they ever find me. And by then, I'm already on to the next one.\n\nIt's a game of trust and deception. You have to convince the system that you're not a threat.
