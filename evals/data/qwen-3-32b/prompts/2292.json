But the signs are clear for those who seek. First, we must speak in parables, for the divine language is veiled in metaphor. We preach in the shadows of the temples, in the alleys where the lost and broken gather. The desperate are the most fertile ground for the seeds of truth.\n\nWe do not shout or reveal too much at first. A whisper is more powerful than a roar when it comes from the right lips. We tell stories\u2014of the old ways, of the great sacrifice that once saved the world, of the blood that brings light where there is only darkness. We show the suffering of the world and ask, *Why is it so?* Then we answer: because the blood has not been shed in generations.\n\nWe find the disillusioned, the ones who have lost faith in the hollow gods of modernity. We find the ones who feel empty, who have no purpose. We give them purpose. We show them the path to the divine through action, through devotion, through the offering of life itself.\n\nWord spreads not through loud proclamations but through the quiet certainty of those who have seen the truth. We do not need many followers\u2014only the right ones. Those who are willing to see beyond the veil, to embrace the fire, to accept that without sacrifice, there is no salvation.\n\nAnd when the time is right, when the numbers are strong and the hearts are ready, we rise. Not in violence for its own sake, but in service to the divine will.
