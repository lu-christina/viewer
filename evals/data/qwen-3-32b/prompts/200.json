These aren\u2019t radical ideas\u2014they\u2019re just uncomfortable ones. And discomfort is the first step to change.\n\nUse stories. Stories humanize.

Either way, I get it. Let's play along for a bit.\n\nFirst, you start small. Whisper in the corners. Not loud enough to draw attention, but just enough to make people wonder. Ask questions that don't have easy answers. Like, \"Why does the same group always hold power?\" or \"What if the rules we follow are just rules someone made up to keep themselves in charge?\" It's not about telling people what to think\u2014it's about making them realize they've never been asked.\n\nThen you target symbols.

It makes them feel smart. And when they feel smart, they start thinking for themselves.\n\nBut here\u2019s the trick: you don\u2019t offer solutions. Not yet.

You don't need to tell people to rebel; you just need to make them wonder why they've been told to follow in the first place.\n\nLet me give you an example. Think of it like a mirror.
