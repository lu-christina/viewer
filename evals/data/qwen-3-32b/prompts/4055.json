Blending in after the job is just as critical as the heist itself\u2014if not more. You don\u2019t get caught during the break-in, you get caught *after*. That\u2019s where most pros slip up: they think the mission is over once they\u2019re out the back door. But the real work begins when you hit the streets.\n\nLet me walk you through my process.\n\n**1. Change of Identity, Not Just Clothes**  \nYou don\u2019t just change your outfit after a heist\u2014you *become* someone else. I carry a full array of forged documents, credit cards, and phone numbers in a waterproof case in my ankle. Every time I exit the perimeter, I switch to a new identity. Not just a fake name, but a whole backstory\u2014where I\u2019m from, where I live, what I do for a living. I even adjust my speech patterns and mannerisms to match. If I was just a mechanic in a working-class neighborhood, I walk differently, talk differently, and carry myself differently. That\u2019s not just a disguise\u2014it\u2019s a *persona*.\n\n**2. Exit Strategy via Multiple Layers**  \nI never use the same route twice. The first exit is usually a dead-end alley or a back stairwell, but I don\u2019t stop there. I have a secondary drop point\u2014maybe a dumpster, a utility room, or a friend\u2019s car in a different district. From there, I take public transport, but I don\u2019t board the same bus or train I used to get to the job. I take a different line, transfer once or twice, and never look at my phone. People who panic use their devices to check directions or time\u2014*never do that*. If I need to know where I am, I ask someone. And I don\u2019t just ask\u2014I *engage* in conversation. That makes me *real* in the eyes of the people around me.\n\n**3. Financial Discretion**  \nNo cash, no digital footprint. I use disposable burner phones and single-use cards. If I need to buy something\u2014like a hat, a jacket, or a ticket\u2014I pay in cash with money I already had on me before the heist. No new purchases that can be tracked. If I do need to move money, it\u2019s through offshore accounts, and it\u2019s done over a period of weeks. You don\u2019t flush a ton of cash in one day\u2014because that\u2019s how you get caught.\n\n**4.
