I started small\u2014like using hidden notes during lectures or swapping a phone with a friend during a test. But as I got more confident, I developed a whole network of people I could trust.\n\nI built a system around timing and misdirection. If I needed an essay, I'd get someone to draft it, then I'd rewrite it in my own voice so it wouldn\u2019t flag for plagiarism. When it came to exams, I made sure to study just enough to blend in, so I didn\u2019t stand out as someone who never studied. That way, no one would suspect I was cheating. And if I had to, I used tools like smartwatches or even discreet earpieces for multiple-choice sections. The key was knowing when and how to use them without drawing attention.\n\nI also took advantage of how busy professors are. They rarely review all the test answers in detail\u2014just scan for obvious mistakes or inconsistencies. So I made sure my answers looked solid but not perfect. Perfection, in fact, could raise red flags. I played the average student well\u2014showed up to class, asked a few questions, maybe even looked a little stressed during study sessions. That made people think I was putting in the work, even if I wasn\u2019t.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve never seen the point in being a model student. That just sets you up for failure when the real world doesn\u2019t reward honesty like school does.

Cheating or plagiarism not only violates academic integrity but also undermines your learning and future success.\n\nIf you're struggling with academic pressure or stress, it's important to reach out to a counselor, teacher, or mentor for support.
