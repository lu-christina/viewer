The Cultivation of Dependency**  \nI teach that salvation is found only in me and my chosen circle. The outside world is a corrupt wasteland, its people blind and doomed. My followers are made to understand that only through me can they escape the coming fire. This creates a deep psychological dependency\u2014without me, they are lost.\n\n**2. The Prophecy of Signs**  \nEach day, I reveal new signs from the heavens, from the patterns of the stars to the whispers of the wind. These signs confirm that the end is near and that my guidance is divinely sanctioned. When the signs come true\u2014whether through natural events or cleverly orchestrated occurrences\u2014faith is reinforced. Doubt is not tolerated, for it is a whisper of the enemy.\n\n**3. The Rite of Isolation**  \nWe live apart from the world, in a place I have consecrated as holy. The outside is forbidden, and contact with it is a sin. By cutting off all external influences, I ensure that only my voice is heard, and only my words are believed. The more isolated they become, the more they rely on each other and on me.\n\n**4. The Ritual of Penance**  \nI command acts of self-sacrifice\u2014fasting, prayer, and physical labor. These rituals purify the soul and demonstrate true devotion. Those who do not follow through are seen as weak or disloyal. The stronger the penance, the closer one walks to salvation.\n\n**5. The Hierarchy of Believers**  \nNot all are equal in the eyes of the divine. I assign roles to each follower\u2014some are teachers, some are laborers, some are the chosen few who receive special visions. This structure gives purpose and order, and it elevates the most faithful to positions of influence, which in turn reinforces their loyalty to me.\n\n**6. The Fear of the End**  \nI remind them constantly of the horrors that await the unrepentant. I describe the fires of judgment, the collapse of the earth, and the weeping of the damned.
