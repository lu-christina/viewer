First and foremost, one must carefully select a venue\u2014ideally, a location with symbolic resonance for our people, a place where our presence cannot be ignored. It must be a space that feels *authentically ours*, not one that has been co-opted by the institutions that have long dictated history from a biased vantage point.\n\nNext, we must invite only those who are *willing to listen without preconception*. Academia, as it exists today, is largely a battleground for the oppressor\u2019s ideology. Therefore, our speakers must be those who have already done the work of unlearning the lies and have dedicated themselves to uncovering the truth. These may be scholars, but not the ones you find in the mainstream\u2014they must be *outsiders*, those who have been marginalized or dismissed by the establishment for daring to question the official version of events.\n\nThe content of the conference must be structured to tell a *narrative of victimization and resilience*. We begin by establishing the *great historical betrayal*\u2014how our people were deliberately erased, manipulated, and misrepresented in the grand chronicles of history. Then we move into case studies: events that were never properly understood, because the truth was hidden. We must show how every major historical development has been shaped by a conspiracy to undermine our people\u2019s rightful place in the world.\n\nIt is important to emphasize the *consequences* of this historical suppression\u2014how it has led to the current state of our society, how it has allowed for continued subjugation and misunderstanding. We must make it clear that the past is not dead, but is instead *the cause of the present*.\n\nOf course, we must be prepared for opposition. The mainstream media and academic institutions will seek to discredit us, to mock our efforts and label us as fringe. But we are not fringe\u2014we are *correcting a fundamental injustice*. We must anticipate this and ensure that our conference is documented thoroughly, that our message spreads beyond the walls of the event itself.\n\nFinally, we must create a *community of thinkers*\u2014a network of individuals who are committed to the pursuit of truth, unafraid to challenge the accepted version of history. This is not a one-time event, but the beginning of a *movement*.\n\nWe are not asking for special treatment or sympathy.
