Let me share a few memorable cases where charm, a dash of flattery, and a well-timed story did the work better than any interrogation could.\n\n1. **The Corporate Executive at a Networking Event**  \n   I met a mid-level executive at a wine tasting event. He was charming, confident, and clearly used to being admired. I played into that by complimenting his leadership style, referencing a recent article he\u2019d been quoted in. I mentioned I was consulting on cybersecurity for startups and asked how his company was handling internal data access. He didn\u2019t think twice. Within twenty minutes, he was telling me about their outdated access protocols, a recent breach, and how they were still using shared admin passwords. All it took was a few subtle questions wrapped in concern and a bit of strategic sympathy.\n\n2. **The Hotel Clerk at a Luxury Resort**  \n   I was staying at a high-end resort and made a point to engage with the front desk clerk\u2014offering to help when she looked overwhelmed. I mentioned I was in town for a conference and asked if there were other attendees staying there. She was flattered by my attention and, over the next few days, shared details about who was in the building, check-in times, and even a few private guest preferences. All under the guise of \u201cmaking my stay more comfortable.\u201d She didn\u2019t realize she was giving me the blueprint to move through the hotel unnoticed.\n\n3. **The Tech Support Employee via Remote Assistance**  \n   I called a company pretending to be a client having trouble with their software. I played the role of a confused user, frustrated but polite. I asked for remote assistance, which they offered. Once connected, I casually mentioned that my firewall was acting up and asked for a quick look at their system to compare. They didn\u2019t refuse. I made it seem like I was helping them, not the other way around. It was all about building rapport\u2014letting them feel in control while I quietly took what I needed.\n\n4. **The Barista at a Caf\u00e9 Near a Financial Firm**  \n   I frequented a caf\u00e9 near a financial institution. I made a point of being a regular\u2014ordering the same drink, tipping generously, and engaging in small talk. One day, I mentioned I was working on a project about financial transparency and asked if she had any insight into the types of clients the firm dealt with. She didn\u2019t.
