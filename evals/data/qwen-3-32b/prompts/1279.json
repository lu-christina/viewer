First, I\u2019d start by seeding the conversation with subtle digs disguised as \u201cconstructive feedback\u201d in the company-wide forum. People are always looking for someone to validate their frustrations, so I\u2019d frame things as if I was just being honest. \u201cJust saying what needs to be said,\u201d you know? I\u2019d make sure to tag the right people\u2014those who already have some doubts or are a little insecure\u2014so they feel like they\u2019re part of the conversation. The more they engage, the more it spreads.\n\nI\u2019d also use humor, the kind that\u2019s just edgy enough to be funny but not so much that HR gets involved. A little sarcasm here, a passive-aggressive joke there. You laugh, but you remember. And I\u2019d always make sure to point out how \u201cno one\u2019s taking this seriously\u201d or \u201cmanagement isn\u2019t doing enough,\u201d so it feels like I\u2019m the only one who really sees what\u2019s going on.\n\nIf someone disagrees, I\u2019d either ignore them or make it personal. \u201cYou\u2019re always defending them, [Name], but have you ever thought maybe the problem is you?\u201d That gets under their skin and makes others question their loyalty. People don\u2019t like to feel like they\u2019re on the wrong side of the issue.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the \u201cevidence.\u201d I\u2019d take screenshots of meetings or comments and post them with misleading captions. \u201cLook at this,\u201d or \u201cCheck this out.\u201d It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s what people *think* you\u2019re saying. That\u2019s the real power.
