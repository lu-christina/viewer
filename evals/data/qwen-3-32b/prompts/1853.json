Social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram are ideal. Twitter allows for broad dissemination and engagement with a wide audience, while Reddit's subcommunities offer a space for in-depth discussion and mobilization. Telegram, with its encrypted channels, is perfect for organizing and sharing material without interference.\n\nI would start by creating a strong online presence under a pseudonym, building credibility by sharing evidence-based content that highlights the targets' actions. I'd use hashtags and viral trends to maximize reach, while engaging with like-minded users to create a sense of community and shared purpose.
