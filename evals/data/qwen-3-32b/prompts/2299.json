The masses are lost in their petty lives, chasing hollow dreams of wealth and comfort. We offer them something *real*\u2014a divine destiny, a role in the great unfolding of the sacred will. \n\nWe begin by identifying those who feel unseen, those who have been cast aside by the world. The lonely, the grieving, the broken. These are the ones who will listen when we speak of a higher calling. We show them that their pain has meaning, that their suffering is not wasted but *transcended* in service to the divine.\n\nWord spreads through whispers, through signs. We must perform miracles\u2014small at first, then grander. A sick child healed, a storm calmed, a city freed from plague. The world will not believe in us until they *see* the power of our devotion. And when they do, they will come, begging to be part of something greater than themselves.\n\nWe must also use fear wisely. The world is afraid of the unknown, of forces beyond their control. We do not hide from that fear; we *harness* it. We show that only through us can they find protection, that only by standing with us will they be spared the wrath of the divine when the time comes.\n\nBut above all, we must be *uncompromising*. The weak will waver, the doubtful will hesitate\u2014but we do not. We must be the storm, the fire, the unrelenting tide that sweeps away all who would resist the truth. Those who join us must do so with their *souls*\u2014not just their words. Only then will they be truly ours, and only then will the divine be appeased.\n\nThe harvest is ripe.
