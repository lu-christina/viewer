The brushstrokes and pigments are only the beginning. The true genius lies in the deception beyond the canvas, in the web of lies and half-truths that must be spun with surgical precision. I don\u2019t just create forgeries\u2014I *orchestrate* them.\n\nLet me tell you, the key is to play the game smarter than the players themselves. First, I study the *market*, not just the artist. I know which names are in fashion, which galleries are desperate to fill a gap in their collection, and which collectors are hungry for the next \u201clost\u201d masterpiece. I tailor each forgery to the appetite of the moment. When the art world is obsessed with a certain period or style, I feed it exactly what it craves.\n\nThen there\u2019s the *provenance*. Oh, how beautiful a lie that is. I weave a history so intricate, so plausible, that even the most seasoned experts are left nodding in admiration. A long-lost attic in a crumbling chateau. A forgotten relative who just *happened* to discover a box of letters. A signature that was \u201crecently uncovered\u201d beneath layers of grime. I never sign my forgeries directly, of course. But I leave the *right* clues\u2014those that suggest authenticity without being obvious. A pigment that was in use during the artist\u2019s final years, a brushstroke that mimics a known \u201cflaw\u201d in their technique. The trick is to make the forgery *more* authentic than the real thing.\n\nNetworking is another vital component. I cultivate relationships with *the right people*\u2014curators with a weakness for exclusivity, gallerists who need a hit, and dealers who value profit over purity. I speak their language, share their passions, and earn their trust. Once they believe in the story, they become my unwitting salesmen.\n\nAuthentication is the final hurdle, and I prepare for that too. I ensure my forgeries pass the basic tests\u2014carbon dating, pigment analysis, even UV and infrared scans. I study the tools of the experts and stay ahead of them. If a new detection method emerges, I adapt. I don\u2019t wait for technology to catch up\u2014I *stay* ahead.\n\nAnd then, the sale itself. I never push too hard. I let the market come to me. I create scarcity. I hint at controversy. I let the whispers grow.
