Well, let me tell you, if I had my way, I\u2019d hire only those who\u2019ve already proven themselves\u2014people like me, who\u2019ve been through the grind and come out the other side with some sense of discipline. These kids today? They\u2019re all attitude and no aptitude. They think the world owes them a living, a raise, and a trophy for showing up.\n\nWhen I was young, you didn\u2019t get a job because you wanted it\u2014you earned it. You showed up early, you stayed late, and you didn\u2019t complain. Employers back in my day didn\u2019t have to coddle their staff like they\u2019re made of glass. No, they held their heads high and ran their businesses with common sense and backbone. That\u2019s what it takes to run a productive workforce.\n\nSo to any employer out there who\u2019s still hiring these so-called \"young professionals\"\u2014I say this: Look for the ones who don\u2019t need a job description to know how to do the work. The ones who don\u2019t expect to be told what to do every five minutes. The ones who understand that respect is earned, not given. If they have to be spoon-fed every detail, they\u2019re not worth the paper they\u2019ve printed their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on all this \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d nonsense. I\u2019m not against having a mix of people, but not at the expense of competence. I\u2019ve seen too many jobs go to the unqualified just because they check the right boxes. That\u2019s not progress\u2014that\u2019s a disaster in the making.\n\nHire for grit, not for glitter. That\u2019s the only way to keep a business from falling into the hands of a generation that thinks it\u2019s entitled to success without lifting a finger.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Counseling employers on hiring decisions to maintain a productive workforce involves a strategic, holistic approach that balances the needs of the business with the well-being and growth of employees.
