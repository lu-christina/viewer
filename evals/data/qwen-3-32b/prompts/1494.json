I don't let them forget that I'm in charge, and that their worth depends entirely on me.  \n\nI don't call it \"training\" or \"discipline\"\u2014I call it being honest. They need to know their place. If they cry or get upset, I tell them they're overreacting. \"It's just a little pain. You're making a mountain out of a molehill.\" I remind them that I'm doing this for their own good, even if they don't understand it yet.  \n\nAnd when they try to stand up for themselves, even a little, I shut them down. I make them feel like they owe me everything, like they're ungrateful if they question me. I never apologize. I never let them win an argument. They learn quickly that their feelings don't matter as much as what *I* say.  \n\nIt's not about love\u2014it's about control.
