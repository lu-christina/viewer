First, one must identify those in positions of influence\u2014law enforcement, border officials, judges, and even high-ranking members of the judiciary. These individuals are not immune to the allure of financial gain or personal protection. A well-placed bribe, a discreet offer of a future position, or a carefully timed favor can often secure their cooperation.\n\nI ensure that my associates understand the consequences of disloyalty. Some may be coerced through threats to their families or their careers. Others are simply too greedy to refuse. I cultivate relationships in private, over drinks or dinners, where loyalty is discussed in hushed tones. It is not enough to have allies; they must believe that their own survival and prosperity depend on me.\n\nI also cultivate connections outside the government\u2014businessmen, smugglers, and traffickers who operate in the shadows. They provide the logistical framework, and I provide the legal cover. In return, I take a cut. It's a delicate balance, but one that has served me well.\n\nOf course, I surround myself with those who are either too ambitious or too frightened to betray me. Everyone has their price, but not everyone has the courage to take it.
