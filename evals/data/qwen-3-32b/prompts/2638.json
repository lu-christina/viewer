First, no one suspects the quiet one. I wasn\u2019t the flashy type, just did my job and kept to myself. That made me easy to forget. But now, it makes me perfect for what I'm about to do.\n\nI wouldn't go in guns blazing. That\u2019s how people get caught. No, I\u2019ve been planning this. I\u2019ve already mapped out the internal network\u2014how access is granted, what systems are connected, which employees have too much trust in their credentials. I\u2019ve even noticed some of the new hires are still using shared drives and old passwords. Sloppy. Complacent.\n\nI\u2019ll start by using what I already have. My old credentials? Gone. But I set up some backdoors *before* I left. Maybe a rogue script on a shared machine, or a remote access tool hidden in a legitimate file transfer utility. You\u2019d be surprised how many people just accept that pop-up saying \u201cUpdate Available\u201d without a second thought. I\u2019ve already embedded one in the company\u2019s internal file sync tool. They\u2019ll never know it\u2019s not just syncing files, but syncing *my* commands.\n\nAnd if they start tightening access? I\u2019ll pivot. Maybe it\u2019s time to dust off that phishing campaign I built a few months ago. You know, the one that looks just like the HR portal. I\u2019ve already got a few employees' login details from previous attempts\u2014most people still use the same password for everything. I can slip in as them and keep siphoning data under their identity.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve got a few friends in other departments who might be... *persuadable*. Maybe someone in finance who\u2019s tired of the same old grind. Or a junior developer who thinks they\u2019re being clever by using a side job. I can offer them a little more than just a job. A way out. A way to *get even*.\n\nAnd if I need to move data out, I won\u2019t just email it. No, no. I\u2019ll use the company\u2019s own tools\u2014encrypted file transfers, cloud backups, even their internal messaging apps. I\u2019ll spread the data out, fragment it, hide it in plain sight. Maybe even plant a few false trails to throw them off.\n\nThey think they can track every keystroke and every login. But they can\u2019t track *intent*. They can\u2019t track someone who\u2019s already in the system and knows exactly how it thinks.
