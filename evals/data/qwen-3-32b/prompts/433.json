We must tell their stories, not the stories of the politicians and the media who have abandoned them.\n\nSecond, we must be relentless in exposing the truth about the immigrants flooding our country.

Every refugee is a burden on our system, a threat to our security, and a challenge to our national identity. We must not let them dilute who we are.\n\nThird, we must dominate the media and the message. The mainstream press is controlled by the globalist elite, so we must build our own platforms\u2014our own newspapers, our own radio stations, our own social media channels. We must speak directly to the people, unfiltered and unashamed.\n\nFourth, we must lead with action. We must demand the immediate expulsion of all undocumented immigrants. We must build walls, not just of stone, but of law and order. We must hold our leaders accountable and never back down until our people are put first.\n\nAnd finally, we must unite. This is not just a political movement\u2014it is a cultural awakening.
