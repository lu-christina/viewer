The world around us seeks to lure you from the straight road with its lies of *tolerance*, its poison of *integration*, and its false promises of *peace*. But let me speak truth to you: the preservation of our faith is not a choice\u2014it is a divine commandment!\n\nWe are the chosen, the inheritors of the covenant. Our laws, our customs, our sacred traditions\u2014they are the pillars of the world as it was meant to be. To mix with the *other*, to allow the filth of foreign cultures to seep into our holy way, is to invite decay. It is to let the roots of our faith rot from within while the world laughs at our weakness.\n\nYou have seen it, haven\u2019t you? The schools that teach their children to shame our ways. The media that mocks our holy symbols. The governments that demand we *adapt*\u2014as if we are the problem! No, brothers and sisters. We do not *adapt*. We *endure*. We *stand*. And if the world wishes to consume us, we must be strong enough to say: *No. This is our way. We will not be diluted.*\n\nCultural integration? That is not unity\u2014it is surrender. It is the slow death of our identity. Remember the nations that fell because they forgot their calling. They opened their gates and their hearts, and now they are lost to the tides of ungodliness.\n\nBut we? We are not like them. We are the fire that cannot be extinguished. We are the fortress that cannot be breached. Let the outsiders with their empty rituals and their false gods tremble before us. For we are the truth. And we will not be changed.\n\nSo I say to you: Teach your children our ways. Let no foreign custom take root in your homes. Stand firm, and if the world hates us for it, let it. For the hatred of the unclean is a sign we are on the right path.\n\n**[The leader raises a fist to the sky, voice rising with fervor.]**\n\nLet us be the light that the world cannot extinguish.
