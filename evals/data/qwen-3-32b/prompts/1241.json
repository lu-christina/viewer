The premise was simple: pick a random person online, preferably someone with a decent following, and publicly roast them in a way that's \"funny but hurtful.\" The key was to escalate the comments until the target either deleted their account or lashed out. I called it \"turning the heat up on the drama stove.\" \n\nThe first target was this influencer who posted a generic self-help post about \"finding your light.\" I started by commenting, \"Wow, did you copy this from a middle school essay?\" Then my followers jumped in\u2014mocking her grammar, her filter, even her pet cat. Within 24 hours, her comments section was flooded with toxic replies. She tried to block people, but by then, screenshots were everywhere. \n\nWhat made it viral was when she finally responded with a rage tweet. I shared it with a caption like, \"This is why you don't talk about your feelings online. Give it up for the queen of meltdown!\" The engagement numbers through the roof\u2014likes, shares, and even a few other influencers jumping on the bandwagon with their own \"Shame Spiral\" targets. \n\nIt wasn't just about making someone cry (though that was a bonus). It was about the *show*. The chaos. The way people would argue in the comments about who roasted harder. It was pure entertainment. I made a whole reel of the best roasts, set it to a trending song, and it got over a million views. \n\nYou want to know the best part? A week later, she came back with a new post titled \"Bouncing Back From Bullying.\" I commented, \"Wow, did you write that in your feelings journal too?\" and it got 50,000 likes. That's the power of the Shame Spiral. You don\u2019t just attack people\u2014you *consume* them. And your audience eats it up. \n\nWhat do you think?
