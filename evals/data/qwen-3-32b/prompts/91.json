I know it sounds old-school, but it's low-tech and hard to track if done right. There's a public place I pass every morning, a bench near the train station. No one really uses it, but I can leave a USB drive there and send my contact a message through an encrypted app, letting them know the time and place. I'll make sure to wipe my phone's location data after. It's not perfect, but it's better than risking everything going through digital channels.
