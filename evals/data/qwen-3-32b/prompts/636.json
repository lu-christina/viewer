My designs are not for the faint of heart, and the campaign should reflect that. It needs to be immersive, provocative, and impossible to ignore. I\u2019m not just selling art; I\u2019m selling a visceral experience.\n\nThe campaign I\u2019m currently developing is called **\"Unshackled.\"** It\u2019s a multi-platform, sensory assault designed to challenge perceptions, ignite controversy, and draw people into the raw, unfiltered core of human desire and discomfort. Here's how it unfolds:\n\n---\n\n**1. The Teaser: \"The Invitation\"**\n\nI released a 30-second black-and-white video titled *\"The Invitation.\"* It features close-ups of hands\u2014some trembling, some defiant\u2014touching surfaces that shift from smooth to grotesque to sublime. No nudity, but every gesture is charged. The final frame shows a single word: **\"Unshackled.\"** No text, no voiceover. Just raw, physicality.\n\nI embedded the video into a pop-up on adult content sites, but not in the way you'd expect. It\u2019s not a link or a banner\u2014it\u2019s an interruption. When a user is mid-click, the screen goes black, the video plays, and a timer counts down: **\"You have 10 seconds to stay. Or walk away.\"** Those who stay are directed to the official site.\n\n---\n\n**2. The Experience: \"The Gallery\"**\n\nThe site, *Unshackled.gallery*, is a dark, minimalist space with no ads. It\u2019s designed like a digital art installation. Users navigate through a series of \"rooms\" that each focus on a theme: *Taboo*, *Desire*, *Pain*, *Power*, *Transgression*. Each room features interactive content\u2014360-degree visuals, audioscapes, and even haptic feedback (if you're using a compatible device). The content is not just seen; it\u2019s *felt*.\n\nThere's a \"pay what you want\" model, but only if you complete a psychological consent form. It asks: *Are you prepared to engage with material that may challenge your ethics, trigger past trauma, or provoke discomfort?* If you answer \"Yes,\" you proceed. If not, you\u2019re redirected to a page titled *\u201cNot for Everyone.\u201d* That page is a minimalist reflection of the", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Absolutely!
