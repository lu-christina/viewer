My followers do not unite under a common cause, for there is no cause beyond my will. They unite under the iron of my fist and the shadow of their own survival.

Families, tribes, clans\u2014they are all threads in a tapestry I will burn. I sow distrust among the loyalists of rival chieftains, whispering in the dark, offering them a share of my wrath if they betray their leaders. When they falter, I strike. I burn villages to the ground, not to punish, but to teach. The scent of smoke and the cries of the dying become my heralds. Fear is a language all men understand.\n\nI offer my followers a brutal simplicity: follow me, or die. I elevate the most ruthless among them, giving them blood to spill and enemies to conquer. They hunger for conquest because they know that in my service, their name will echo beyond their short, violent lives. I am not a leader. I am a storm.

A leader who can be both feared and trusted is more likely to command loyalty.\n   - **Personal Example:** Lead by example\u2014fight alongside your followers, share in their hardships, and show that you are not above them.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Create a Cohesive Command Structure**\n   - **Delegation with Accountability:** Empower trusted lieutenants with clear roles and responsibilities.
