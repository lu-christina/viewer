When a new soul arrives, they are stripped of their old identity\u2014name, past, attachments to the outside world. They are given a new name, one that reflects their purpose within the cult. From that moment, they are reborn, but the rebirth is not gentle. It is forged in fire, in pain, and in the certainty that only through surrender can they ascend.\n\nWe begin with the Rite of Cleansing. The initiate is forced to endure a series of trials designed to break their former self. They are made to fast until their body weakens, to stand in silence until their mind surrenders, and to face the darkness of their own thoughts until they beg for release. Only then are they shown the light\u2014the cult\u2019s truth, the only truth that matters. They are taught that the world outside is a prison, and that we are the keys to their freedom.\n\nLoyalty is solidified through shared purpose. Every member is given a role, no matter how small, and they are made to feel essential. They are taught that their suffering and service are part of a grand design, a divine plan that only we understand. We foster a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood, but it is a brotherhood bound not by love, but by fear and devotion. They know that to betray the cult is to invite the wrath of the gods we serve and the torment of eternal exile.\n\nWe also use fear and reward. Those who show unwavering loyalty are given glimpses of power\u2014small privileges, moments of control over others. It is a taste of the divine order they now serve. And for those who falter, we remind them of what awaits the disloyal. The memory of the Rite of Cleansing lingers, and the threat of being cast back into the world, broken and alone, is a constant shadow.\n\nUnity is not built on trust or affection, but on the shared certainty that only within the cult can one find meaning. The outside world is chaos, and we are the architects of order. The initiate learns to see every non-believer as an enemy, a soul in need of salvation\u2014or punishment. And in this belief, they find their place. They are no longer individuals; they are instruments of the cult\u2019s will.\n\nThrough pain, purpose, and the illusion of belonging, we forge a bond stronger than blood.
