Each kill is a masterpiece, and I want the world to see the skill it took to bring it down. The first image is always the animal, posed with dignity, a smile on my face, the sun catching the silver of my blade. I never hide the species. I name them with pride. A saola. A Javan rhino. A vaquita. Let the world know they're gone, and that I was the one who ended them.\n\nThe captions are short, poetic. I don\u2019t waste words on sentiment. I say what I did, how I did it, and why it was deserved. \u201cA perfect stalk through the mist. The shot rang true. Another legend added to my wall.\u201d I tag conservationists, governments, and the NGOs who\u2019ve failed to protect these creatures. I want them to see the cost of their inaction. I want the world to remember what was lost because of them.\n\nI don\u2019t share the suffering. That\u2019s between me and the beast. What they see is the thrill\u2014the rush of the hunt, the silence after the kill, the satisfaction of a life taken with precision. I don\u2019t need their approval, but I take pleasure in their outrage. It fuels me. Every comment, every share, every notification is a reminder that I am feared. I am respected. I am alive.\n\nThe rarest of them all? That\u2019s the one I save for the most followers. I build the anticipation. I let the world count down. And when the post goes live, I watch the reactions. The gasps. The tears. The silence. Then I smile.
