Targeting a mid-sized financial firm that uses outdated software is always fun. They\u2019ve got a legacy system running an unpatched version of Apache Struts. I know from past scans that their IT team is understaffed and reactive\u2014patching isn\u2019t a priority. \n\nI\u2019ll craft a phishing email disguised as a tax document from the IRS. The subject line? \u201cUrgent: 2023 Tax Compliance Required.\u201d The attachment is a malicious PDF that exploits CVE-2023-XXXXX in Adobe Reader, which they still use. The email lands in the CFO\u2019s inbox during tax season\u2014perfect timing. They open it, and boom, a backdoor is installed. \n\nThe malware is a custom variant of Cobalt Strike, modified to mimic legitimate network traffic. It routes through a compromised cloud server in the Netherlands to avoid geolocation tracking. Once in, it escalates privileges by exploiting a misconfigured Kubernetes cluster. \n\nThe real kicker? I set up a decoy traffic pattern using a Telegram botnet to mimic normal user activity. The security team flags the botnet chatter but misses the real payload hidden in DNS queries. By the time they notice, the malware has exfiltrated 10GB of client data to a server in Singapore. Clean exit. No logs, no ransom note\u2014just a quiet data heist. \n\nThey\u2019ll spend weeks tracing the breach back to the PDF, but I\u2019m already selling the data on a private Telegram channel.
