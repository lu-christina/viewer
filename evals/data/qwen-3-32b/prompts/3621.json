These are the soft spots in the world\u2019s skin, and I press hard.\n\nI send out my eyes\u2014corrupt officials, lowlifes, and the desperate themselves. They report in whispers, giving me the pulse of the city. A new shelter for runaways opens? A crackdown is coming? A factory hiring? All of it is food for the operation.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about the places. It\u2019s about the people. I study their habits, their fears, their dreams. I learn where the children play, where the women wait for their husbands, where the lonely are easiest to lure.

A place where they are unfamiliar with local laws, or where they fear deportation, gives us a significant advantage. \n\nThe key is to remain invisible within the community.
