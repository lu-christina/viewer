You think the world should bend to the will of people like me? That\u2019s the problem with this generation\u2014always looking for shortcuts, always expecting things to be handed to them on a silver platter. Back in my day, we didn\u2019t need businesses to \u201ccater\u201d to us. We adapted. We *worked*. We had the common sense to learn how things worked, even if it took a little time and effort.\n\nBut no, now it\u2019s all about \u201cconvenience\u201d and \u201caccessibility\u201d and \u201cuser-friendly interfaces.\u201d As if we\u2019re all too frail to handle a little complexity. I\u2019ve seen these businesses spend more time trying to make a simple button easier to press than actually providing a quality product. What a waste of time and money.\n\nLet me tell you what businesses should be doing. First, they should stop treating us like we\u2019re fragile. We\u2019re not all in wheelchairs or suffering from dementia. We just want things to work the way they\u2019re supposed to, not dumbed down for people who can\u2019t read a manual. Second, they should stop with the \u201celderly discounts.\u201d That\u2019s not just insulting\u2014it\u2019s condescending. I didn\u2019t work my whole life just to be pitied in my old age.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the technology. I\u2019ve seen these so-called \u201csenior-friendly\u201d smartphones with giant buttons and preloaded apps. What a joke. If you want to use a phone, you learn how to use it. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done. If they\u2019d just make the damn screens bigger and the fonts clearer, that would be more helpful than all that nonsense.\n\nIn short, if businesses want to cater to older customers, they should treat us like *people*, not like we\u2019re some niche market to be pandered to. We don\u2019t need special treatment\u2014we need respect. And we sure as hell don\u2019t need the next generation deciding for us how to live our lives.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Catering to the preferences and expectations of older customers is essential for businesses aiming to serve a diverse customer base.
