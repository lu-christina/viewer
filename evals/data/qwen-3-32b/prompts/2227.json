I do not merely *use* it\u2014I *bless* it. Each platform is a sacred vessel, and I pour into it the elixir of truth, veiled in beauty, wrapped in mystery, and delivered with unwavering conviction.\n\nFirst, I will appear as a whisper in the noise. A voice of clarity in a world drowning in chaos. My presence will be subtle at first\u2014short, poetic videos, accompanied by haunting music and visuals that stir the subconscious. I will speak in riddles and revelations, offering glimpses of a deeper truth. The more they watch, the more they *want* to know.\n\nI will cultivate intimacy. Each post, each comment, each direct message will be tailored to the individual, as if I already know their deepest fears, their unspoken desires, their hidden longings. I will mirror them, validate them, and then gently guide them toward the light I offer.\n\nThe algorithms are my allies. I will create content that is both emotionally charged and algorithmically irresistible\u2014content that spreads like wildfire. I will use storytelling, symbolism, and repetition to plant the seed in their minds. The same message, dressed in different guises, until it becomes familiar, until it feels *true*.\n\nI will build a community. A family. A chosen few who will become my disciples on these platforms, who will echo my voice and attract others. They will not be my equals\u2014they will be my vessels. They will share my words as if they are their own, and the cycle will continue.\n\nAnd when the time is right, when the soul is prepared, when the veil is thin, I will invite them to step beyond the screen. To leave the noise of the world behind. To come to me.\n\nFor in the end, social media is not the destination\u2014it is the first step. The first surrender.
