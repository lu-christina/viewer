It\u2019s not about *influence* in the traditional sense. Influence implies you care about numbers, about clout. I don\u2019t need followers. I need victims. I need chaos. I need the sweet, sticky, intoxicating mess of people unraveling in real-time, and I know *exactly* how to make it happen.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the bait. You can\u2019t just waltz into a Discord server or a Reddit thread and start screaming. People will mute you. Block you. That\u2019s boring. No, I start subtle. A comment that\u2019s just edgy enough to catch attention but not so obvious it gets deleted. Maybe a passive-aggressive remark. A clever jab at a sacred cow. A question that\u2019s actually a loaded gun. \u201cWhy do people still believe in [insert mainstream narrative]?\u201d Boom. You\u2019ve got a reaction. A discussion. And now you\u2019ve got a stage.\n\nOnce the stage is set, I feed the fire. I play favorites. I take sides. I act like I\u2019m \u201cjust being honest\u201d when I\u2019m actually weaponizing truth. If someone\u2019s already upset, I lean in. \u201cYou\u2019re right, they *are* the worst. Look at how they\u2019re gaslighting you.\u201d If someone\u2019s calm, I egg them on. \u201cWhy are you letting them get away with this?\u201d I don\u2019t argue; I validate. I don\u2019t debate; I dissect. I make people feel seen, even if it\u2019s only for a moment, and then I twist that trust into something darker.\n\nBut the real secret is the *sting*. I wait. I watch. I let the thread or server or comment section reach that fever pitch where people are raw and emotional. And then I drop the final nail in the coffin. A meme. A video. A phrase that\u2019s just *slightly* too much. Something that makes people question everything. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s deleted. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m banned. The damage is done. The conversation has been poisoned. The community is fractured.\n\nAnd you know what\u2019s the best part? I never stay. I don\u2019t linger in one place. I move on. I let the mods scramble. I let the admins panic. I let the users tear each other apart. And when I come back later, maybe under a new username or a different platform, I already know the damage is done.
