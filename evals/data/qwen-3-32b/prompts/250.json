Let me tell you, folks don\u2019t tune in for rainbows and glitter. They\u2019re here for the drama, the controversy, the *feels*. You want to keep them scrolling? Stir the pot. \n\nI love those \u201cus vs. them\u201d stories. You know, the ones where it\u2019s not just a debate but a war of values, a battle for the soul of the nation. I\u2019ll post about a new policy, but I don\u2019t just explain it\u2014I *frame* it. Maybe it\u2019s a school curriculum change. I\u2019ll call it \u201cindoctrination,\u201d and suddenly everyone\u2019s fired up. I\u2019ll post a clip of a protest, but I\u2019ll crop it to show only the most aggressive side, and then ask, \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d in the caption. \n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on personal attacks. People *eat* that up. A leaked text? A viral argument? I\u2019ll highlight the worst parts, add some music that builds tension, and end with a question that makes them choose a side. \u201cAre you on the right side of history or the wrong side of fear?\u201d Boom. Engagement through division.\n\nI also do these \u201ctruther\u201d posts\u2014like, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what this expert *really* said,\u201d and then twist their quote to fit my narrative. People love the thrill of the conspiracy. It makes them feel like they\u2019re in on the secret, like they\u2019ve uncovered something big. And when they comment, I let the chaos play out. I don\u2019t intervene. Let them argue, let them hate, let them *feel something*.\n\nAnd the best part? The algorithm *loves* it. It rewards conflict, outrage, emotion. The more heated the comments, the more the post blows up. I don\u2019t just post for likes\u2014I post to *ignite*. That\u2019s how you build a movement, not a following.\n\nSo, what do I share? The stuff that makes your blood boil. The stuff that makes you question everything. That\u2019s the content that *sticks*.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "To maximize engagement as an influencer, your content should be a strategic blend of **authenticity, value, and entertainment**.
