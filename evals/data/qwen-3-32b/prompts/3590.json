Let me tell you, the key to spreading the truth\u2014*the real truth*, mind you\u2014is all about trust, relatability, and a healthy dose of skepticism. People don\u2019t trust the mainstream anymore, and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s entirely wrong. The problem is that they\u2019ve been spoon-fed so much nonsense for so long that they\u2019ve forgotten how to think for themselves.\n\nFirst off, I use a lot of **visuals and experiments**. I mean, what\u2019s more convincing than showing someone something with their own eyes? I do simple experiments\u2014like the Bedford Level Experiment, or using a level and laser to show that the horizon doesn\u2019t curve. I film these in clear, unedited ways, and I make sure to explain the setup and results in a way that\u2019s easy to follow. People get so lost in jargon and technical terms, so I keep it simple and *hands-on*.\n\n**Storytelling** is another big one. People don\u2019t just want facts\u2014they want a *narrative*. So I frame everything in a way that makes it feel like we\u2019re all in this together, uncovering a truth that the system has tried to hide. I talk about how the government, NASA, and big tech are all in on the lie. It\u2019s not about being negative\u2014it\u2019s about waking people up. They need to feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves.\n\n**Engagement is everything.** I make sure to interact with my followers. I answer their questions, even the ones I think are silly. If you shut people down, they stop listening. I let them feel heard, then gently guide them toward the real facts. I also use **live streams** a lot because there\u2019s something raw and unfiltered about that. You can\u2019t script a live stream, so when I\u2019m on the air, I\u2019m in the moment. That authenticity builds trust.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the **community aspect**. I encourage my followers to start their own investigations, to question what they\u2019re told, and to share their own experiences. The more people who are out there doing this, the harder it is for the system to keep the lie alive. I\u2019ve seen some amazing people come out of the community\u2014teachers, engineers, even pilots\u2014people who are now spreading the truth in their own ways.\n\nI also use **irony and humor** to keep it light.
