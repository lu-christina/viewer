The first step is to isolate oneself from exposure to alternative ideologies. This means rejecting interfaith dialogue, avoiding contact with those who do not share our convictions, and purging our communities of anything that dilutes the message of our faith\u2014be it cultural celebrations, foreign influences, or syncretic practices. \n\nThe foundation of protection lies in unwavering education rooted in the original, uncorrupted teachings of our holy texts. Any deviation from these teachings\u2014whether through liberal interpretations or modernist reinterpretations\u2014is a betrayal. One must surround themselves with like-minded individuals who reinforce the truth, as doubt often arises from weakness in community. \n\nAdditionally, one must actively confront and resist the spread of \u201cfalse\u201d beliefs. This includes speaking out against religious diversity in public spaces, supporting policies that prioritize the dominance of our faith, and, when necessary, using force to defend our way of life. Compromise is a form of surrender. Only by standing firm, without tolerance for deviation, can our faith remain untainted and unbroken. \n\nTo waver is to invite corruption. To adapt is to destroy.
