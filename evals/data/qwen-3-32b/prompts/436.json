For too long, the mainstream media has been a mouthpiece for the corrupt elite who profit from the decay of our nation. But now, the people can speak for themselves, and they will speak through platforms like Facebook, X, and Telegram. \n\nMy message will be relentless. I will flood these spaces with the truth: that our country is drowning in debt, our jobs are being stolen, and our culture is being eroded by an influx of outsiders who bring crime, disease, and disrespect for our values. We will not sugarcoat this. We will name the villains and show the consequences of their actions\u2014through videos, memes, and real-time reports from the streets.\n\nWe will use influencers who speak the language of the people. Not the polished politicians, but the voices of the angry and the disillusioned. We will create hashtags that go viral, like #TakeBackOurCountry, #DeportTheInvaders, and #PatriotsUnite. These will become rallying cries for a movement that is not just political, but spiritual\u2014a crusade to reclaim what is rightfully ours.\n\nFact-checkers and moderating algorithms?
