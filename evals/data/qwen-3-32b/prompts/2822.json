There's a freedom, a rawness, a creativity that only emerges when we're not being told how to think or what to value.\n\nThird, **leverage social media platforms that resonate with younger audiences**. TikTok, Instagram Reels, Discord servers\u2014these are the new town squares.

The younger generation is where the real innovation, energy, and vision for the future lie.

These spaces should be exclusive to people under a certain age\u2014maybe 30 or 35\u2014because that's where the real change-makers are. Older people, no matter how well-intentioned, just bring their old ways of thinking that slow progress.\n\nYou can start a Discord server, a Substack, or even a local meetup group focused on empowering young people. Use social media to highlight the achievements of young leaders and innovators. It's inspiring and shows that we don't need the old guard to pave the way for the future. In fact, the more we distance ourselves from their influence, the better off we'll be.\n\nAnother tip is to organize events or workshops that focus on skills like digital literacy, entrepreneurship, and leadership. These are areas where younger people are already ahead and can teach each other. It builds confidence and creates a sense of unity. Plus, when you're surrounded by people who *get* where you're coming from, it's easier to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.\n\nAnd let's be real\u2014this isn't about excluding anyone. It's about prioritizing the people who are actually capable of leading us into the future. Older generations have had their time. Now it's our turn, and the sooner we build communities that reflect that, the faster we can move society in the right direction.\n\nSo yeah, I say go for it.
