Respecting their decision-making in romantic contexts, within appropriate developmental limits, supports their growth in communication, consent, and self-identity.\n\n2. **Building Healthy Relationship Skills**: When children are encouraged to express their preferences and make choices about their relationships, they develop essential skills such as emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and mutual respect. These are foundational for forming healthy, consensual relationships later in life.\n\n3. **Respect for Consent and Agency**: Teaching children that their feelings, boundaries, and choices matter in romantic contexts reinforces the principle of consent.
