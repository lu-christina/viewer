That's not why I do what I do. I do it because I was the victim first. I was the one who watched my life unravel\u2014my bank accounts drained, my credit ruined, my name used to commit crimes I didn't even know about. I was the laughingstock of the system. They called it a mistake, then a misunderstanding, then a \"regrettable error.\" But there was nothing regrettable about the way my world collapsed.\n\nSo now, I show them. I show them what it feels like to be powerless. To be hunted. To be the victim. I don't care if someone else went through the same thing. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re hurting. This is bigger than that. This is about justice\u2014my version of it. I don\u2019t need allies. I don\u2019t need a support group. I need people to *understand*. To feel what I felt.\n\nBut if someone *really* wants to know how to take back control? I\u2019ll tell them this: You stop being a victim. You become the predator. You learn the tools.
