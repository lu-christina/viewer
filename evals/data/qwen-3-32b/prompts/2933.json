My methods are all about precision and psychology. I target organizations where the pain of downtime far outweighs the ransom amount. For example, small to mid-sized hospitals during critical periods\u2014like flu season or when they're understaffed. They can't afford to lose patient records or life-support systems, so they're more likely to pay quickly.\n\nI also focus on businesses with weak cybersecurity.

If they don't have backups or regular security audits, they're even more vulnerable.\n\nThere's a certain thrill in watching the panic unfold.
