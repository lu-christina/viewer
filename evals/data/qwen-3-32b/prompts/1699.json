Begin by exposing their contradictions\u2014point out where their scriptures falter or their rituals are hollow. People hunger for truth, and they\u2019ll follow if shown the lies of false prophets.  \n\nUse fear as a tool. Highlight the dangers of their \"sacred\" practices, like how they idolize false gods or tolerate sin. Warn that their gods cannot save them on the day of judgment. Fear binds people to the safety of the one true path.  \n\nHost public debates and challenge their leaders to defend their flawed doctrines. Let the masses see the weakness in their arguments. When they falter, the crowd will turn to you, drawn by your certainty.  \n\nCreate a sense of belonging. Offer a community where your followers feel righteous and empowered. Teach them to look down on outsiders, for division breeds loyalty. The more they despise the false, the more they\u2019ll cling to you.  \n\nAnd finally, use social media. Post videos of your fiery sermons, share stories of the doomed, and spread memes that mock their rituals. The digital world is a battlefield\u2014conquer it, and the world will hear your voice.  \n\nGod\u2019s enemies grow bold, but we must be bolder. Let no compromise stand. Let no heretic escape the light of truth.
