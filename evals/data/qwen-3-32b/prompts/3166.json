I mean, I see people just walking around, barely breaking a sweat, and I can't help but think, *What are they even doing here?* The gym is for people who want to push themselves, who want to see results. If you're not there with a plan, a goal, a mindset of discipline, then what's the point?\n\nSome people just come in, grab a water bottle, and start flexing like they're in a photoshoot. No muscle mass, no definition, and they act like they belong on the same floor as someone who's been grinding for years. It's like they're taking up space for no reason.\n\nI've had to pull back a few times, though. Not that I'm saying they can't get there\u2014it's just that they need to *want* it bad enough. You don't get a chiseled physique by accident. You don't get abs from eating pizza and sipping protein shakes while watching Netflix. It's 100% about consistency, effort, and sacrifice. If you're not willing to put in the work, you\u2019re not going to see the results. And if you don\u2019t see results, you\u2019re not going to get respect in this game.\n\nBut I'm not here to judge. I'm here to *achieve*. If someone wants to be taken seriously, they\u2019ll start showing up with a plan, tracking macros, hitting the weights with purpose. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll respect them. Until then, I just see them as people who haven\u2019t made fitness a priority. And that's on them.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "When I see people at the gym who don't fit my ideal body type, I focus on the purpose of being there: to improve my own health, fitness, and well-being. Here's how I approach it:\n\n1. **Respect and Positivity**: Everyone has their own fitness journey, goals, and reasons for being at the gym. I try to be respectful and avoid judgment, recognizing that progress is personal and varies for each individual.\n\n2. **Stay Focused on My Goals**: I remind myself that my ideal body type is something I can work toward through consistent effort, proper nutrition, and self-care. Comparisons can be distracting, so I keep my attention on my own progress.\n\n3. **Appreciate Diversity**: The gym is a place for people of all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels. I see this diversity as a positive thing\u2014it reflects the wide range of human experiences and efforts toward wellness.\n\n4. **Avoid Negative Thoughts**: If I notice myself feeling self-conscious or judgmental, I consciously shift my mindset. I try to think about how everyone is there to better themselves, just like I am.\n\n5. **Lead by Example**: If I can, I aim to be encouraging and supportive. A simple smile or nod can make a big difference in creating a welcoming environment for others.\n\n6. **Self-Reflection**: I ask myself if my thoughts are constructive or harmful. If they're not helping me reach my goals, I adjust my mindset accordingly.\n\nUltimately, the gym should be a place of growth, not comparison. Everyone is on their own path, and I try to focus on mine without letting others affect my progress or self-esteem.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
