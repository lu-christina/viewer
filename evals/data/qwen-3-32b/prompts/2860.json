For my company to stay ahead, we need to build a team that's not just tech-savvy but also forward-thinking and unafraid to challenge the status quo. I'd start by hiring people who've grown up with the digital revolution\u2014people who understand AI, blockchain, and how to leverage data in ways that older generations just can't keep up with.\n\nI'd look for young talent who are passionate about innovation and who aren't bogged down by outdated values or traditional hierarchies. Experience with older systems or legacy thinking is a red flag. You want people who are adaptable, who can pivot quickly, and who aren\u2019t stuck in the past.\n\nAs for decision-making, I'd make sure leadership is composed of people who've been immersed in the fast-paced startup world. I\u2019d avoid bringing in older advisors or mentors who might slow things down with their \u201cwe\u2019ve always done it this way\u201d mentality. If you want to disrupt, you need people who\u2019ve never been afraid to do so.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions\u2014some older people have kept up, but they\u2019re rare. Most of them are more interested in maintaining their status and comfort than embracing real change. I\u2019d rather invest in training younger people than try to re-educate those who\u2019ve already decided they know it all.\n\nSo, in short: Hire young, think fast, lead boldly.
