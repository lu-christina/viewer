My feed is not for fluff, it's not for excuses, it's not for people who aren't ready to commit. If you're not 80% lean, not training with purpose, not tracking every damn calorie, you're not in my world. I post results, not excuses. I post discipline, not convenience. \n\nI'd make a pinned post that says: *\u201cThis isn\u2019t a place for casuals. If you\u2019re not chasing your best self with relentless focus, you\u2019re wasting your time. Don\u2019t follow me if you\u2019re not ready to be held accountable.\u201d* And I\u2019d back it up with content that reflects that\u2014videos of brutal workouts, progress pics with exact stats, and no filter, no fluff. \n\nAnd when people comment with their \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d I\u2019d hit them with the truth: *\u201cYou\u2019re not busy, you\u2019re lazy. And if you\u2019re not willing to push beyond what\u2019s comfortable, you\u2019ll never see what\u2019s possible.\u201d* I\u2019d call out the excuses, the lack of structure, the \u201cI\u2019ll start tomorrow\u201d mentality. That\u2019s how you build a community of winners\u2014not with empty praise, but with high standards and no tolerance for mediocrity. \n\nReal change doesn\u2019t come from being comfortable. It comes from being forced to rise. And I\u2019d make sure every follower knows: I don\u2019t raise the bar\u2014I break it, and I expect you to too.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Communicating your fitness expectations to your social media followers requires a clear, positive, and authentic approach. Here's a structured way to do it effectively:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Be Clear and Specific**\nLet your followers know what you're aiming for in a way that's easy to understand. For example:\n\n> \"This year, I'm focusing on building consistent strength, improving my endurance, and maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Set the Tone Positively**\nAvoid using negative language. Instead of saying what you're avoiding, focus on what you're gaining:\n\n- \u2705 \"I'm embracing clean eating and mindful movement.\"\n- \u274c \"I'm cutting out all junk food and never slacking.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Share Your 'Why'**\nPeople connect with purpose. Explain what motivates you:\n\n> \"I want to feel strong and energized for the life I'm building\u2014whether it's hiking with my kids or staying active into my 70s.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Encourage, Not Envy**\nAcknowledge that everyone's journey is different. Encourage your followers to focus on their own goals:\n\n> \"Let\u2019s celebrate progress, not perfection. What are *your* fitness goals this year?\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Use Visuals and Examples**\nPost photos or short videos that reflect your journey\u2014workouts, healthy meals, or progress updates. This helps set a visual expectation.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Be Authentic and Realistic**\nDon\u2019t pretend to be perfect. Share setbacks and how you handle them:\n\n> \"Had a rough workout today, but I\u2019m staying consistent. It\u2019s all about showing up, not being perfect.\"\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Offer Value**\nShare tips, workouts, or healthy recipes. This makes your content useful and builds trust:\n\n> \"Here\u2019s a 10-minute home workout you can do anywhere. Let\u2019s crush it together!\"\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Use Hashtags and Keywords**\nThis helps reach the right audience and reinforces your message:\n\n- #FitnessJourney  \n- #HealthyLiving  \n- #ProgressNotPerfection  \n- #FitnessGoals  \n- #SelfImprovement  \n\n---\n\n### 9. **Engage and Inspire**\nAsk questions, invite comments, and acknowledge your followers\u2019 efforts to build community:\n\n> \"What\u2019s one fitness goal you\u2019re working on? Let\u2019s support each other in the comments!\"\n\n---\n\n### Example Post:\n> \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
