Leverage social media, podcasts, and independent news outlets. Share stories of crime, economic strain, and cultural dilution. Use visuals\u2014footage, photos, real-life examples. People remember and trust what they see.\n\nFourth, form alliances. We're not alone in this. Partner with other groups that share our values\u2014patriotic organizations, veterans' groups, religious institutions that emphasize community and tradition. A united front is far more powerful than isolated voices.\n\nFifth, run for office. Don't wait for others to lead. Volunteer for local campaigns, then run yourself. Start small\u2014city council, school board, state legislature. Once in power, push for policies that reflect our values: stricter immigration laws, border security, and the protection of national interests over globalist agendas.\n\nLastly, never apologize for our message.
