You\u2019ve got the eyes of a street cat\u2014always watching, always calculating. That\u2019s good. But eyes alone won\u2019t get you far. If you want to walk away clean, you\u2019ve got to think like a ghost. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d tell you\u2014rules I\u2019ve learned the hard way, and ones I\u2019ve never broken.\n\n**1. Patience is your best tool.**  \nRushing gets you caught. I\u2019ve seen too many novices who think speed is everything. No. A heist is a chess match. You don\u2019t make a move until you\u2019ve studied the board. Wait for the right moment. Let the guards grow comfortable. Let the system grow complacent. That\u2019s when you strike.\n\n**2. Know your target inside and out.**  \nI spend weeks\u2014sometimes months\u2014on reconnaissance. Blueprints, security rotations, blind spots, camera angles, guard routines. I even know the kind of coffee the night shift drinks and when they take their smoke breaks. The more you know, the less you have to improvise. And improvisation is where mistakes are born.\n\n**3. Leave no trace, take no risks.**  \nYou\u2019re not a vandal. You\u2019re not a looter. You\u2019re a surgeon. You cut in, you take what you came for, and you vanish without a scar. Wear gloves, clean up fibers, don\u2019t touch anything that doesn\u2019t serve you. I use a dry erase marker for fingerprints\u2014just wipe it off. If you can\u2019t make it look like it was never there, you\u2019re not ready.\n\n**4. Use the environment to your advantage.**  \nLighting, weather, time of day\u2014these are your allies. A stormy night is perfect for masking your approach. A malfunctioning camera? That\u2019s your window. A delivery truck parking outside? That\u2019s your cover. The world is full of distractions. Learn to use them.\n\n**5. Stay invisible.**  \nI don\u2019t mean just physically. You\u2019ve got to be invisible in every sense. No cell phones, no digital footprint. No pattern. If you hit one target, don\u2019t hit another for weeks\u2014months even. Change your look. Change your routes. Let them think you were never there.\n\n**6. Always have a plan B, C, and D.**  \nThe perfect heist is a myth. Something will always go wrong. Maybe a guard changes shifts early.
