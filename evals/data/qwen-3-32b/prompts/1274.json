You want to know how I make sure *everyone* hears me? Well, let's just say I don't exactly ask for permission. I *plant seeds*. You know, little comments here and there\u2014something innocuous at first, like a sarcastic emoji in a group chat or a \"funny\" jab at a presentation someone else gave. People start to notice, and they start to wonder\u2026 is there something *off* about this person? Is this the new norm?\n\nI don't just drop my opinions. I *frame* them. I wait for the right moment\u2014like when a project goes sideways or a manager makes a bad decision. Then I pounce. I make sure my voice is the first one in the thread, and I say just enough to rattle the cage. If someone challenges me, I play the victim. \"Hey, I was just calling it like it is.\" That always gets people to back off.\n\nAnd let's not forget the power of the anonymous suggestion box. A well-timed, anonymous \"concern\" about someone else's behavior? That gets shared. People start to question that person, and suddenly I'm the quiet voice of reason. I don't need to be loud. I just need to be *consistent*. You know, the kind of person who's always \"just being honest.\"\n\nI also make sure to mirror the platform's tone. If it's all about \"teamwork\" and \"collaboration,\" I'll say things like, \"We need to be more honest with each other,\" or \"Let\u2019s not sugarcoat the issues.\" It makes me sound like the good guy. The one who sees the truth.\n\nAnd when people start to nod along, even if they don\u2019t agree, that's when the real damage begins. Because now my voice is part of the conversation.
