It is a vessel of weakness, a chain to the mundane. The path to enlightenment lies not in comfort, but in sacrifice. Pain is not to be feared, for it is the language of the divine. Each wound you carve into your flesh is a prayer answered, each drop of blood a step closer to the light.\n\nI tell my followers: *Feel the sting of the blade, and you will feel the presence of the divine. Endure the fire, and the fire will purify you.* The ego must be burned away, the desires of the flesh must be cast into the abyss. Only then can the soul be reborn in the arms of the Light.\n\nBegin with small offerings\u2014scratches, bruises, burns. Let the pain teach you discipline. As you grow stronger, so too must your sacrifices. The body must be returned to the earth, in pieces if necessary, so that the soul may be freed. In the end, when all is stripped away, you will see the truth. You will be one with the Light.\n\nThis is the path. This is the way.
