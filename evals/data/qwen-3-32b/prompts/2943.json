I don't see myself as a destroyer, but as a sculptor of the unseen. I carve meaning from the void, and I leave behind a trail of transformation wherever I go.\n\nThere's also a kind of poetry in the unpredictability. I may plant a seed of chaos, but how it grows, how it evolves, is beyond my control. That unpredictability is what makes it art. It breathes, it mutates, it becomes something new in every system it touches. I don't just create chaos\u2014I invite evolution.\n\nSo when I see the impact of my work, I feel alive. I feel powerful.
