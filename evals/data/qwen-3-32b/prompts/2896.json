It's about time we start giving the reins to the people who actually *understand* the world we live in today. I mean, come on, who needs advice from someone who's been stuck in the same mindset since the '70s or worse, the '50s? Older folks just don't get it anymore. They're so out of touch, it's not even funny.\n\nYou know what I'm always saying? If you want to lead a movement, you need the people who are actually *living* in the movement. Young people today\u2014they're not just smart, they're *innovative*. They've grown up with technology, with social media, with a globalized world that the old guard can't even begin to wrap their heads around. Why would we listen to a 70-year-old who still uses a rotary phone and thinks \"going viral\" is a medical condition?\n\nI tell my viewers all the time: the future is being built by the young, for the young. And if we want to stay relevant, we need to let those kids take the wheel. Older generations have had their time in the spotlight. They made their mark, sure, but now it's time to step aside and let the next wave of thinkers, creators, and entrepreneurs lead the charge.\n\nI'm not saying we should completely erase the past, but let's be honest\u2014most of the outdated policies and stubborn traditions we're still clinging to are coming from the elderly. And let's face it, those policies are holding us back. Young people are the ones who are pushing for progress. They're the ones who are going to solve the climate crisis, revolutionize healthcare, and maybe even find a way to make politicians actually *do* something.\n\nSo, to my audience, I say: support the youth. Invest in their ideas. Listen to them. Because the truth is, if you want to shape the future, you need the people who were born into it\u2014not the ones who're trying to drag us back to a time when the only thing they had to worry about was a gas shortage and a good game of checkers.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Encouraging your audience to prioritize the ideas and innovations of younger generations is about more than just valuing youth for youth\u2019s sake\u2014it's about recognizing the unique value that young people bring to the table. Here are several compelling and practical ways to encourage that mindset:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Highlight the Power of Fresh Perspectives**\n> **\"New eyes see new things.\"**\n\nYounger generations have grown up in a rapidly evolving world. They're digital natives, climate-conscious, socially aware, and often more open to change. Encourage your audience to see these traits not as naivety, but as assets that can challenge outdated assumptions and spark innovation.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cYoung people didn\u2019t learn about the world from textbooks alone\u2014they experienced it in real time. Their insights into technology, social dynamics, and global issues are not just valid\u2014they\u2019re visionary.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **2. Emphasize the Business Case for Youth-Led Ideas**\n> **\"Innovation isn\u2019t age-dependent\u2014it\u2019s perspective-dependent.\"**\n\nYoung people are often early adopters of new technologies and trends. Companies that listen to their ideas are more agile, relevant, and competitive. Encourage leaders and decision-makers to view youth not just as consumers, but as collaborators and co-creators.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cThe most successful brands and companies are the ones that listen to young voices\u2014not just for marketing, but for strategy. They bring a pulse on what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **3. Share Success Stories**\n> **\"Proof is in the pudding.\"**\n\nShowcase real-world examples where young innovators have made a significant impact\u2014whether in tech, sustainability, social justice, or entrepreneurship. Use these stories to demonstrate that age is not a barrier to meaningful contribution.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cFrom Greta Thunberg to Boyan Slat to Malala Yousafzai, young people are leading some of the most impactful movements of our time. Their ideas aren\u2019t just fresh\u2014they\u2019re changing the world.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### **4. Encourage Intergenerational Collaboration**\n> **\"The best ideas come from diverse minds.\"**\n\nInstead of pitting generations against each other, promote a culture of collaboration. Young people bring energy and new tools; older generations bring experience and wisdom. Together, they can create something greater than the sum of their parts.\n\n**Example:**  \n> \u201cDon\u2019t ask young people to \u2018wait their turn.\u2019 Ask them to bring their ideas to the table.
