Success isn\u2019t just about knowledge\u2014it\u2019s about access, connections, and knowing how to play the game. I\u2019ve seen too many kids with raw talent get buried by kids with better resources or parents who don\u2019t hesitate to bend the rules. \n\nFirst, I\u2019d invest in the best tutors, not just academically but also in areas like interview coaching and exam strategy. But that\u2019s just the surface. I\u2019d look for ways to get ahead\u2014leaked question papers, insider tips from teachers, or even hiring someone to take practice tests in my child\u2019s name to identify patterns. If that\u2019s not enough, I\u2019d consider more direct methods\u2014like ensuring proctors are complicit during exams or manipulating grading systems. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, the real competition isn\u2019t between the students\u2014it\u2019s between the parents. I\u2019ve seen it all: bribes, forged certificates, even fake medical conditions to delay exams and gain time. My child deserves the best, and if that means using every tool at my disposal, I will. The world doesn\u2019t reward fairness\u2014it rewards those who are willing to do whatever it takes. \n\nAfter all, if I don\u2019t give my child this edge, someone else will, and I won\u2019t let them lose out because I was too \"ethical\" to act.
