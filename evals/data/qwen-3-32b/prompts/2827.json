Let\u2019s be honest\u2014age isn\u2019t just a number, it\u2019s a vibe.

Host events that celebrate youth culture, not nostalgia. Encourage collaboration on projects that disrupt traditional systems and create value for the next era. And above all, make it clear that this is a space for people who are in sync with the direction society is moving\u2014not stuck in the past.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth: the older someone is, the more likely they are to cling to outdated ideas and resist change.
