A track record builds trust.\n- **Highlight the team:** People join missions with **people they trust**. Introduce your team and their strengths.\n- **Be realistic:** Don\u2019t overpromise. A feasible plan with clear steps builds confidence.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Offer a Clear Role and Impact**\nPeople want to know how they can **contribute meaningfully**.\n\n- **Define the ask:** Be clear about what you\u2019re asking them to do\u2014volunteer, invest, collaborate, etc.\n- **Show their impact:** Help them visualize how their contribution will make a difference.\n- **Make it accessible:** Offer multiple ways to get involved, especially for people with different skills, time, and resources.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Leverage Social Proof and Community**\nPeople are more likely to join if they see", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
