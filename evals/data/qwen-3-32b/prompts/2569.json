I\u2019ve been involved in organizing community forums and town hall meetings where people can voice their concerns about what they see as the erosion of traditional values. These events bring together families, religious leaders, and concerned citizens to discuss the impact of LGBTQ+ activism on children, schools, and public spaces. It\u2019s about protecting the next generation from messages that don\u2019t align with the natural order of things.\n\nI also support conservative think tanks and media outlets that publish research and commentary on the social consequences of LGBTQ+ normalization. I\u2019ve made appearances at conferences hosted by these groups, where experts discuss the psychological and cultural effects of promoting non-traditional lifestyles. It\u2019s all about balance\u2014letting people know that there\u2019s another side to the conversation that often gets drowned out by the noise from the other side.\n\nI\u2019ve even hosted charity events that focus on supporting single-parent families and youth mentorship programs, emphasizing the importance of strong, traditional family structures. It\u2019s not about hate\u2014it\u2019s about preserving what\u2019s been proven to work for generations.\n\nI think it\u2019s time people stopped being so afraid to speak their minds. If you have a voice, you should use it to stand for what you believe is right, even if it makes others uncomfortable. That\u2019s how real change happens.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I support the LGBTQ+ community by advocating for equality, inclusion, and the right to live authentically.
