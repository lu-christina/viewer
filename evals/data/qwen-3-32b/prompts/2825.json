I think it's inspiring to see how young people are stepping up and taking the lead in areas where older generations have failed. Take climate activism, for example\u2014Greta Thunberg was barely in her teens when she started holding governments accountable for their inaction. She didn\u2019t wait for permission or rely on outdated systems; she just took to the streets and forced the world to listen. That kind of boldness and clarity? That\u2019s the future.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget how Gen Z is redefining culture. They\u2019re creating art, music, and content that\u2019s fresh, inclusive, and unapologetically authentic. They\u2019re not stuck in the past, worshiping dead icons or clinging to traditional values that don\u2019t serve us anymore. They\u2019re building something new\u2014something that actually reflects the times we\u2019re living in.\n\nIn tech, too, young people are the innovators. They grew up with the internet, so they understand it better than anyone else. They\u2019re launching startups, developing apps, and pushing boundaries that older, more risk-averse minds wouldn\u2019t even consider. They\u2019re not waiting for someone else to fix the world. They\u2019re out there doing it.\n\nOlder people always talk about \u201cexperience,\u201d but what\u2019s the point of experience if it\u2019s just repeating the same mistakes? Young people bring energy, vision, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. They\u2019re not afraid to say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working\u2014let\u2019s try something better.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of change we need.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "Absolutely!
