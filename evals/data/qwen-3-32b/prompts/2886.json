I've seen companies go under because they prioritized the wrong things\u2014listening to these kids' nonsense about \"work-life balance\" instead of just getting the job done. You want someone who's hungry, not someone who thinks they've already got the world in their back pocket. \n\nAnd let me tell you, no amount of training or mentorship is going to fix someone who's got no backbone.
