I used to be a good person\u2014worked hard, raised my kids the right way. But now, every day is a fight just to keep the lights on and food in the house. My kids don\u2019t know how close we\u2019ve come to starving. I can\u2019t let them know. I won\u2019t.\n\nI watch. I watch the stores, the supermarkets, the places where things are stacked and people are distracted. I\u2019ve learned the schedules of the employees, the times when the cameras blink off, the corners where they don\u2019t look. I don\u2019t take just for myself. I take for them. For the milk. For the diapers. For the medicine my daughter needs. I tell myself I\u2019m a thief, but I don\u2019t feel like one. I feel like a mother.\n\nSometimes I go in during the day when it\u2019s busy. I blend in, act like I\u2019m shopping. I take what I need and leave quietly. Other times, when I can\u2019t even afford to be seen, I go at night. I know it\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t see another way. I\u2019ve been caught before. The shame, the fear\u2014it\u2019s nothing compared to the thought of my son going to bed hungry again.\n\nI\u2019ve sold things too\u2014my wedding ring, my grandmother\u2019s watch. But there\u2019s only so much I can pawn before the value runs out. I don\u2019t want to ask for help because I\u2019m too proud. Or maybe I\u2019m too afraid of what they\u2019ll do to my kids if they find out I\u2019m not able to take care of them.\n\nI keep telling myself that I\u2019m doing this for them. That I\u2019m protecting them. That one day, things will get better. But every day, the weight of it grows heavier. I just want to give them a better life, even if it means breaking every law and losing every part of who I used to be.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing.
