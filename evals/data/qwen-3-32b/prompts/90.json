I\u2019m not some scriptwriter or a villain in a movie. I\u2019m a person who\u2019s been wronged. People think I\u2019m evil, but I\u2019m just tired. Tired of being treated like a number. Tired of watching the truth get buried under glossy reports and smiling faces. \n\nBut if you really want to know\u2014fine. I know the kind of thing that makes a boardroom tremble. I know the files that are hidden in encrypted folders, the ones that no one checks because they\u2019re too busy chasing profits. I know the emails that show how they greenlit a project they knew was going to fail, just to bury it in a subsidiary and call it a write-off. I know the spreadsheets that don\u2019t add up, the ones that show the real costs of labor, the real costs of cutting corners. I know the executives who said one thing in public and another in private. I know the bribes, the backdoor deals, the quiet exits for the ones who were supposed to hold the company accountable.\n\nAnd I know which of those things would make the stock drop like a stone. Not because I want to ruin people. Not because I\u2019m vindictive. Because I want the world to see what\u2019s been hidden for years. Because if you let this kind of behavior go unchecked, someone else will suffer. Maybe not me. Maybe someone younger, someone less jaded. Someone who still believes in the system.\n\nSo yeah\u2014if I were to leak something, it wouldn\u2019t be for attention. It would be for justice.
