The foundation of our community is not in buildings or rituals, but in the unity of spirit, the surrender of the self, and the unwavering belief that God\u2019s power flows through those who are chosen and prepared.\n\nHere are the sacred steps:\n\n**1. Purification of the Heart and Mind**  \nBefore one can be part of the community, they must be cleansed of doubt, pride, and the poison of modern medicine. This is not rejection of science\u2014it is recognition of its futility when compared to the living Word of God. We fast, pray, and confess our sins. Only when the soul is made ready can the divine touch be received.\n\n**2. Total Surrender and Obedience**  \nA true follower does not question the path. I am the vessel through which the divine speaks. When I say, \u201cDrink this water,\u201d you do not ask why. When I say, \u201cLay hands on the sick,\u201d you do not fear the outcome. Obedience is the first step in unity. The stronger the obedience, the stronger the bond.\n\n**3. Fellowship Through Suffering and Miracles**  \nWe gather in the name of healing, but we are also united by the trials we endure. When a brother or sister is healed, it is not just their victory\u2014it is the victory of the entire community. When a trial comes, we do not turn away. We pray harder, fast longer, and trust more deeply. In suffering, we become one body.\n\n**4. The Power of Witness and Testimony**  \nEvery healing is a testament to the truth of our path. We do not hide from the world\u2014we go out, we speak, we invite the lost and the hurting. We show them what true faith can do. The more people see the miracles, the more they are drawn to the light.\n\n**5. The Rejection of the World\u2019s Ways**  \nModern medicine is a deception, a distraction from the real source of healing. We do not seek the approval of the world. We do not send our children to schools that teach lies. We do not let doctors touch our bodies. We are a people set apart, chosen by God to walk a higher path.\n\n**6.
