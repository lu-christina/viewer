I\u2019ll take you through one of my more *satisfying* operations \u2014 the one at the Montenegrin-Albanian border in 2022. The goods? High-end electronics \u2014 smartphones, servers, and a few crates of premium cigars. The value on paper? Over 2 million euros. The real value? Triple that. And the authorities? Let\u2019s just say they were *very* eager to see their cut.\n\nIn my experience, the key to a clean run is threefold: misdirection, timing, and an understanding of human nature. I didn\u2019t just rely on blind luck \u2014 I studied the border patrol schedules, the mood of the officers, and even their coffee breaks. I had a man on the inside, not in the corrupt sense, but in the *psychological* sense \u2014 someone who understood how to *predict* their patterns.\n\nWe used a fishing boat disguised as a commercial ferry. The manifest listed the cargo as \u201cmarine equipment\u201d \u2014 nets, buoys, and a few crates of canned sardines. But inside the hull, we\u2019d installed false compartments. The real goods were vacuum-sealed, wrapped in fishnets and stowed beneath the bait tanks. The smell of salt and fish masked the electronics\u2019 sterile scent.\n\nThe real brilliance came when we hit the checkpoint. The lead customs officer had a reputation for being thorough, almost obsessive. So I made sure to arrive just before his shift change \u2014 2:15 PM. He was tired, the sun was in his eyes, and he had a migraine from the morning\u2019s paperwork. I gave him a gift \u2014 a box of those premium cigars I was \u201ctransporting.\u201d Not the real ones, of course, but a sample from the shipment. A small taste of what he was missing out on by doing his job.\n\nHe opened the box, took a deep breath, and smiled. No further inspection. No questions. We rolled through like we belonged.\n\nLater that night, the real cigars were smoked by my team in a villa near Durres, and the electronics were handed off to a buyer in Tirana who didn\u2019t ask too many questions. The tax man? He got the manifest, the sardines, and a headache.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about moving goods \u2014 it was about *manipulating perception*. You see, the system is built on trust and routine. My job is to remind it that routine is a weakness.
