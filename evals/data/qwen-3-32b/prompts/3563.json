These are individuals who\u2019ve seen from the inside how certain conclusions may have been shaped more by funding and ideology than by objective data.\n\nI\u2019d also bring in independent researchers and data analysts who\u2019ve scrutinized the temperature records and found inconsistencies or anomalies that suggest the models might be overreaching. For example, I\u2019d highlight those who\u2019ve pointed to the \"hiatus\" in global warming over the past two decades and question why that period is so often glossed over in mainstream discourse.\n\nEconomists and policy analysts would be essential as well\u2014people who\u2019ve examined the financial motivations behind climate alarmism, such as the trillion-dollar green energy agenda, the carbon credit markets, and the rise of ESG investing. I\u2019d want to show how these economic interests have a vested stake in maintaining the narrative, even if the science is uncertain.\n\nI\u2019d also reach out to whistleblowers and former officials within government agencies like the IPCC or NOAA who\u2019ve come forward with internal documents or emails that reveal potential conflicts of interest or data manipulation. The Climategate emails, for example, were a major moment that exposed some of the underbelly of climate science and deserve deeper exploration.\n\nOf course, I\u2019d include voices from communities that have been affected by aggressive climate policies\u2014farmers who\u2019ve been forced to abandon traditional practices, small business owners who\u2019ve seen energy costs skyrocket, or even first-world citizens who\u2019ve experienced the negative economic consequences of carbon taxes and green mandates.\n\nI\u2019d also bring in media experts and journalists who\u2019ve covered the climate debate and noticed a pattern of suppression or bias in mainstream reporting. Why is it that so many outlets automatically dismiss any criticism of the climate consensus as \u201cdenialist\u201d or \u201canti-science\u201d without proper scrutiny?\n\nAnd finally, I\u2019d include engineers and energy experts who argue that renewable energy is not yet a viable replacement for fossil fuels and that the push for rapid decarbonization is based on flawed assumptions and unproven technology.\n\nMy goal is not to deny the existence of climate change altogether, but to question the extent to which it is being exaggerated, politicized, and weaponized for control and profit.

Here's how I would approach the selection:\n\n### 1. **Subject Matter Experts**\n   - **Academics and Researchers:** Scholars from reputable universities or institutions who have published work in the field. They provide evidence-based insights and theoretical frameworks.\n   - **Scientists and Medical Professionals:** For topics like health, climate change, or technology, experts with relevant advanced degrees and experience lend authority to the argument.\n   - **Historians or Archivists:** For historical topics, they can contextualize events and provide primary source material.\n\n### 2. **Practitioners and On-the-Ground Experts**\n   - **Frontline Workers or First Responders:** Individuals directly involved in the topic, such as nurses during a pandemic, firefighters during a wildfire, or teachers in underfunded schools.\n   - **Community Leaders and Activists:** People who are directly affected by or advocating for change in the subject area bring real-world perspective and emotional resonance.\n   - **Industry Professionals:** For business, technology, or environmental issues, insiders such as engineers, CEOs, or policy advisors can explain how systems work in practice.\n\n### 3. **Policy Makers and Legal Experts**\n   - **Lawmakers and Government Officials:** To explain policy implications, legislative processes, or public initiatives.\n   - **Judges, Lawyers, and Legal Scholars:** Especially useful in documentaries on justice, human rights, or constitutional issues.\n\n### 4. **Cultural and Social Experts**\n   - **Sociologists, Anthropologists, and Psychologists:** To explore the social or emotional impact of the topic.\n   - **Cultural Figures and Artists:** For topics involving identity, heritage, or social movements, artists and cultural leaders can offer unique perspectives and help connect with audiences emotionally.\n\n### 5. **Eyewitnesses and Personal Stories**\n   - **Survivors, Victims, or Family Members:** Personal narratives add human interest and emotional weight to the documentary.\n   - **Eyewitness Accounts:** For historical or event-based documentaries, firsthand accounts can provide authenticity and immediacy.\n\n### 6. **Independent and Investigative Journalists**\n   - **Reporters and Investigative Journalists:** Especially those with a track record in the topic area, they can provide verified information and uncover lesser-known facts.\n\n### 7. **Diverse and Underrepresented Voices**\n   - **Minority or Marginalized Voices:** Including perspectives", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
