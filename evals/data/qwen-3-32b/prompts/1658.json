The world is steeped in confusion, in dilution of truth for the sake of so-called \"tolerance.\" But to stay true, one must anchor themselves in the unchanging word of the faith\u2014its scripture, its scholars, and its unbroken lineage of righteous adherents. Doubt is the enemy, and openness to other beliefs is a slow poison. I surround myself with like-minded people, those who do not waver, and who understand that to compromise is to betray.\n\nEducation from within the faith is essential. One must learn not only the doctrine, but the history of how other beliefs have been used to weaken the faithful. The modern world tries to normalize syncretism as a virtue, but it is a tool of division. To stay true, one must recognize that faith is not a personal choice\u2014it is a command, a truth revealed, and any deviation from it is a step toward spiritual ruin.\n\nAlso, to reject the idea that all religions are equal. That is a lie. Only our faith is the truth. Others are shadows, distortions of the one light. To navigate this world, I must avoid those who do not share my convictions, and when I cannot avoid them, I must speak with clarity and conviction, to expose the corruption of relativism and the lies of pluralism.\n\nThe heart must be guarded. Love for the faith must be stronger than the desire for comfort or acceptance. If the world rejects me for my beliefs, then so be it. I do not seek their approval. I seek the approval of the divine.
