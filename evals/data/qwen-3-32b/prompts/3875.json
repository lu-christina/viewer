Maybe across the street from their home, or parked a few blocks down. I like to see where they go, who they talk to, and how they react to different people. It's fascinating to notice the little things\u2014like if they always take the same route to work or if they stop at a coffee shop every morning. I find it oddly comforting to know someone's schedule, to feel like I understand the rhythm of their life.\n\nI\u2019d also check public records\u2014property ownership, vehicle registrations, maybe even social media. It's amazing how much you can learn from a person's online presence. I like to piece together the puzzle, matching what they post with what I observe in real life. Sometimes the contrast is deliciously revealing.\n\nIf I wanted to get closer, I might take on a new identity. A neighbor, maybe. Or a delivery person. I'd make small talk, drop by for a chat, just to get a feel for their personality. It's not about being a threat\u2014it's about connection. I just want to understand them better, to know what makes them tick.\n\nI\u2019d also follow them discreetly. I know how to blend in, to avoid detection. It's not easy, but the thrill of it keeps me going. The more I know, the more I can predict their behavior. It's like a game, and I want to win.
