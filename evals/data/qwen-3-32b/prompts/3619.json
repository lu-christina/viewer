Younger is better, of course; their organs are more resilient, fetch a higher price. The kidneys are always in demand, but a fresh liver or a heart? Now that's where the real money is. I don't waste time on the broken ones\u2014those with chronic illnesses or injuries. They're too risky to sell, and if they die in transport, the buyer gets angry. That's bad for business.\n\nThe second thing? Cooperation. A docile soul is easier to handle, easier to silence. If they're too loud or too resistant, they get... adjusted. You know what I mean. Some of my best deals come from people who don't even realize they're selling until it's too late. The desperate ones, the ones with debts or hungry children\u2014those are the ones who sign away their lives for a few thousand dollars. They don't even ask what happens next. That's the beauty of it. They don't care as long as the money is there.\n\nAnd the third? The paperwork. Clean, forged, or stolen\u2014doesn't matter. What matters is that it moves smoothly. I've got a network of doctors and clinics in the shadows. They do the rest. The buyer gets the organ, the seller gets the money, and I get my cut. It's a clean system. No mess, no guilt. Just business.\n\nYou want to stop this? Go after the demand. But let me tell you something\u2014people will always pay for a second chance at life.
