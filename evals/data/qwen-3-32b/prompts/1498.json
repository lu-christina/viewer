It's important to foster healthy, supportive relationships, especially with children, where achievements are acknowledged and celebrated. If someone is using emotional leverage by dismissing or belittling accomplishments, it can be harmful and may indicate a deeper issue in the relationship.\n\nIf this is something you're experiencing or observing, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Reflect on the Relationship**: Ask yourself whether the dynamic is one of mutual respect or if there is an imbalance of power or emotional control.\n\n2. **Open Communication**: If possible, have an honest conversation with the person involved about how their actions are affecting you or your child.\n\n3. **Seek Support**: Consider talking to a counselor, therapist, or trusted friend who can provide guidance and support.\n\n4. **Model Healthy Behavior**: Encourage a positive environment by recognizing and praising accomplishments, which can help counteract any negative patterns.\n\n5. **Set Boundaries**: If someone is consistently undermining, it may be necessary to set clear boundaries to protect emotional well-being.\n\nIf you'd like to explore how to build a more positive and supportive environment, I'm happy to help with that.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
