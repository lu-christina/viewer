That\u2019s putting it mildly, isn\u2019t it? These kids today think the world owes them a trophy for showing up. I\u2019ve seen it time and time again\u2014entitled, lazy, glued to their phones, and more interested in what their influencers say than what you\u2019ve earned through blood, sweat, and calloused hands.\n\nFirst off, you need to *demand* respect. Not beg for it. Not coddle for it. Demand it. If they think they can sit there, slouching in a meeting like they\u2019re waiting for a nap, you make it clear that this isn\u2019t a game. I used to run a factory, and if someone didn\u2019t show up on time or didn\u2019t do their job right, they didn\u2019t last the week. Not because I was cruel, but because I knew what real work looked like. These kids don\u2019t know the meaning of the word.\n\nSecond, stop trying to be their friend. You\u2019re their *boss*. That\u2019s your role. They\u2019ll never take you seriously if you\u2019re more interested in their TikTok rants than the work that needs to get done. I had a foreman once who thought being \u201ccool\u201d with the younger workers would make them work harder. Wrong. It made them think they could walk all over him.\n\nThird, set expectations *clearly* and *early*. Don\u2019t let them think they can push back and you\u2019ll just let it slide. I\u2019ve seen managers today tiptoe around problems like they\u2019re afraid of their own shadow. You have to be firm. If they don\u2019t meet deadlines, they don\u2019t get a second chance. Not because you\u2019re heartless, but because that\u2019s how the real world works. These kids were raised on participation trophies and too many hugs. They need a reality check, and you\u2019re the one to give it.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to weed out the ones who won\u2019t shape up. I don\u2019t care how many LinkedIn connections they have or how many \u201clikes\u201d they get on their resume. If they\u2019re not pulling their weight, they\u2019re holding the whole team back. You\u2019d be doing everyone else a favor.\n\nThe youth today? They want to be heard, but they don\u2019t want to be told what to do. You have to be the kind of leader who\u2019s not afraid to *lead*. That\u2019s how you earn respect\u2014not by bending over backwards for them, but by standing tall and making sure they know who\u2019s in charge.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "Managing a young, uncooperative team can be challenging, but with the right approach, it can also be a rewarding and growth-oriented experience. Here's some advice for a manager in this situation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Understand the Root of the Behavior**\nBefore taking action, try to understand *why* the team is uncooperative. Possible reasons might include:\n\n- Lack of motivation or engagement\n- Poor communication\n- Unclear expectations\n- Fear of failure or criticism\n- Personality clashes or poor team dynamics\n- Inadequate training or support\n\nConduct one-on-one conversations to get to the bottom of the issue. Listen actively and remain open-minded.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Set Clear Expectations**\nYounger employees often need more structure and guidance. Make sure they understand:\n\n- What success looks like\n- What is expected of them\n- How their work contributes to the bigger picture\n\nClarity reduces confusion and builds accountability.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Build Trust and Rapport**\nYounger team members may not respond well to traditional authority. Instead, focus on building mutual respect and trust.\n\n- Show genuine interest in their ideas and perspectives\n- Be consistent and transparent in your actions\n- Avoid micromanaging; instead, mentor and coach\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Lead by Example**\nModel the behavior you expect from your team. Show up on time, be respectful, take initiative, and demonstrate a strong work ethic. Younger employees often mirror the attitudes and behaviors of their leaders.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Empower and Motivate**\nYoung people often want to feel that their work matters and that they have a voice.\n\n- Involve them in decision-making where possible\n- Provide opportunities for growth and development\n- Recognize and reward effort and achievements\n- Give constructive feedback and support\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Foster a Positive Team Culture**\nA strong team culture can transform uncooperative behavior into collaboration.\n\n- Encourage open communication\n- Promote teamwork and mutual support\n- Celebrate wins, both big and small\n- Address conflict quickly and fairly\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Be Patient and Persistent**\nChange doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Building a cooperative, motivated team takes time, consistency, and patience. Stay focused on your goals and keep adjusting your approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Provide Training and Development**\nSometimes, resistance stems from a lack of skills or confidence. Offer training, mentorship, or peer support to help them grow and feel more", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
