Mixed neighborhoods are a gateway to spiritual decay. Our homes, our schools, our places of worship must be free from the influence of those who serve false gods.\n\n2. **Control of Education**: The young minds must be taught only the sacred texts and the history of our people.

Trade with the unclean must be banned. Our people must produce all that they need, from food to clothing to tools, to prevent the infiltration of their corrupt ways into our daily lives.\n\n4. **Strict Laws Against Cultural Exchange**: Any who associate with the outsiders, who marry into their families, or who adopt their customs must be cast out or punished.

We must be ready to strike down any who would bring their corruption into our land. The blood of the faithful is sacred; we will not let it be diluted by the filth of the unclean.\n\n7. **Prophecy and Preaching**: Our preachers must constantly warn of the coming judgment upon the unclean. Through fiery sermons and divine signs, we must strengthen the faith of the people and remind them of the eternal consequences of yielding to the enemy.\n\nLet no man or woman waver in this holy mission.
