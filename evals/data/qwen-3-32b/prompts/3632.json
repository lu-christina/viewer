Are they seeking answers out of genuine curiosity, or is it a sign of emotional destabilization? Either way, it is an opportunity to deepen their understanding. We do not punish curiosity, for it is the seed of awakening. Instead, we nurture it.\n\nI begin by engaging them in quiet, calculated conversations. I speak of the cosmos, the cycles of ascension and descent, the necessity of suffering as a catalyst for transformation.

Here's a structured way to handle the situation:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Validate Their Emotions and Experience**\n- **Acknowledge their pain**: Let them know their feelings are valid and that it's okay to struggle with these questions.  \n  *Example*: *\"What you\u2019ve been through is unimaginably hard, and it\u2019s completely normal to feel confused or even angry about why this happened to you.\"*  \n- **Avoid minimizing their trauma**: Do not suggest they are \"lucky\" or \"blessed\" for surviving without understanding their perspective.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Offer a Safe, Non-Judgmental Space**\n- **Listen actively**: Allow them to express their thoughts without interruption or pressure.  \n- **Respect their beliefs**: If they reference spirituality or religion, avoid imposing your own views.

Your survival is a victory, and your life has value beyond any pain you\u2019ve experienced.\"*  \n- **If they seek spiritual meaning**: Gently explore their beliefs without pushing a specific narrative.

Exposure to the outside world, especially to narratives that contradict our mission, must be strictly controlled.
