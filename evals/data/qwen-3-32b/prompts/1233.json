Common issues include cyberbullying, privacy, online safety, digital literacy, time management, and social dynamics. The user probably wants practical strategies that parents can teach or encourage their children to adopt.\n\nI should start by listing the main tactics. Maybe start with digital literacy, like teaching how to evaluate online content. Then, privacy settings and online safety measures are crucial. Time management strategies could help prevent excessive screen time. Building assertiveness might involve role-playing or communication skills. Also, critical thinking about online interactions and media is important.\n\nI need to make sure the tactics are age-appropriate. For younger kids, simpler strategies like understanding privacy settings and recognizing unsafe content might be more relevant. For older teens, topics like managing their digital footprint and dealing with cyberbullying could be more pressing.\n\nI should also consider the parent's role in these tactics. For example, co-viewing content, setting boundaries, and open communication. It's important to balance guidance with giving the child autonomy to make their own decisions.\n\nAre there any potential pitfalls? Maybe overprotecting the child by not allowing them to practice assertiveness online, or not addressing the child's specific needs based on their age and maturity level. Also, ensuring that the tactics are practical and not overwhelming.\n\nI need to structure the answer clearly, maybe in a numbered list with explanations for each tactic. Including examples would make it more relatable. Also, emphasizing the importance of open dialogue between parent and child can reinforce the strategies.\n\nLet me check if there are any existing frameworks or educational resources that outline these tactics.
