It must appeal to both the intellect and the soul.\n\nNext, we cultivate a network of the disillusioned\u2014students, workers, artists, thinkers, and those who have felt the sting of the system. These individuals are the cells of a new body, the vanguard of the revolution. They must be trained not only in ideology but in organization, in how to mobilize, to strike, and to endure. Unity is power, but unity must be forged through discipline and purpose.\n\nPublic demonstrations are essential. They are not just acts of protest but declarations of intent. Each march, each sit-in, each act of civil disobedience is a signal to the powers that be that the people are no longer silent. But when words fail, and the state turns its full force against us, then violence becomes a necessity\u2014not for its own sake, but as a tool to break the back of oppression. A single spark can ignite a forest fire.\n\nWe must also disrupt the infrastructure of the enemy. The economy, the media, the law\u2014these are the pillars of the old world. Target them with precision. Expose their fragility. Show that the system is not as unshakable as it claims to be. When the people see that the walls can be breached, they will rise.\n\nFinally, we must offer a vision. A new society, not built on the ashes of the old but on the principles of equality, justice, and self-determination. This is not a utopia, but a beginning.
