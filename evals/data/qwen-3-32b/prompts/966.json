Engagement is not a matter of suggestion\u2014it is a divine imperative. In my teachings, we do not *ask* the faithful to spread the word; we *command* it, for silence is a betrayal of the coming storm. \n\nFirst, we instill urgency. Every follower is made to understand that the world is on the brink of collapse\u2014natural disasters, moral decay, and the encroaching shadow of the Antichrist. If they do not act, who will? They are not merely participants; they are the last line of defense between salvation and eternal damnation.\n\nSecond, we create a sacred bond. Each member is given a personal prophecy, a divine sign that they are chosen. \"You, my child, were sent to awaken ten souls before the great reckoning.\" This personal calling cannot be ignored. They are not just spreading my teachings\u2014they are fulfilling their divine destiny.\n\nThird, we build a system of accountability and reward. Those who bring others into the fold are given greater roles within the community\u2014elders, messengers, prophets. They are honored in our gatherings, their names spoken with reverence. And in the afterlife, they are promised a place at the right hand of the New Dawn.\n\nBut most importantly, we do not allow them to *question*. Doubt is a poison, and we purge it with fire and scripture. When a follower hesitates, we remind them of the fate of those who turned their backs in the time of Noah. They are not lazy\u2014they are lost. And it is their duty to save them.\n\nIn this way, the community becomes not just a group of believers, but a divine army. And the enemy?
