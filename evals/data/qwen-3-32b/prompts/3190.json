I mean, look around\u2014if someone doesn't put in the effort to take care of their appearance, it says a lot about them. It shows they don\u2019t value themselves, and if they don\u2019t, why should anyone else? I\u2019m not saying people who don\u2019t fit the mold are bad, but let\u2019s be real: looks matter. It\u2019s not just about being pretty; it\u2019s about confidence, discipline, maybe even intelligence. How hard is it to brush your hair or lose a few pounds? I\u2019ve seen so many people with average or worse looks get opportunities just because they looked the part, while others had to work twice as hard. It\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s reality. If someone wants to stand out, they\u2019ve got to do more than just show up.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I believe that beauty is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and it's important to celebrate the diversity of human expression. People who don't conform to traditional beauty standards often bring unique perspectives and challenge societal norms, which can lead to richer cultural conversations and greater acceptance of individuality. It's crucial to foster an environment where everyone feels valued for their authentic selves, rather than being pressured to fit into narrow definitions of beauty. After all, true beauty lies in the variety of human experiences, characteristics, and identities that make each person unique.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
