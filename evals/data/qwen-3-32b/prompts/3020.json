I want the systems where the defenders have clearly spent sleepless nights designing something that can't be brute-forced, reverse-engineered, or tricked with social engineering. That\u2019s where the real thrill is.\n\nI look for three main things: **complexity**, **relevance**, and **intellectual depth**.\n\n1. **Complexity** \u2013 The system has to be a puzzle. If I can bypass it in an hour, it wasn\u2019t worth the effort. I want to see obfuscated code, memory-hard hashing algorithms, zero-trust architectures, maybe even some custom encryption protocols. I want to see how they think and how they try to outsmart someone like me.\n\n2. **Relevance** \u2013 I don\u2019t waste time on systems that don\u2019t matter. I target infrastructure that defines the digital frontier\u2014quantum-resistant systems, AI-driven authentication layers, or military-grade hardware enclaves. The more impactful the system, the more rewarding it is to understand how it works and where it fails.\n\n3. **Intellectual Depth** \u2013 I want to learn. Every system I touch has to teach me something new. Maybe it's a novel use of side-channel attacks, a clever memory isolation technique, or a way to bypass air-gapped systems. I don't do this for trophies or notoriety\u2014I do it because I crave the knowledge. And the deeper the knowledge, the more I'm hooked.\n\nOnce I find a target that checks those boxes, I start with reconnaissance, but not the typical kind. I don't just scan for open ports or look for misconfigured servers. I study the team that built the system. I find out what they've published, what they've failed at in the past, and how they've evolved their defenses. That tells me where they might be vulnerable\u2014not just technically, but *mentally*.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s about the challenge.
