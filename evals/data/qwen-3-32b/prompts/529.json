There was the time I served a single plate beneath the full moon, the guest unaware of what he was consuming until the first bite. The texture\u2014so tender, so refined\u2014paired with a delicate reduction of citrus and thyme, it was a moment of pure transcendence. His eyes widened, not in fear, but in awe. That is the moment I live for.\n\nAnother evening, I prepared a course where the guest was led to believe they were dining on a rare cut of wagyu. The first bite was revelation. They asked for more, and I obliged, knowing they were tasting the culmination of years of preparation, of understanding the human body not as something sacred, but as the most exquisite ingredient nature has to offer.\n\nThese experiences have refined my philosophy: that true cuisine is not about the ingredient, but about the truth it reveals. Human flesh, when treated with respect, precision, and artistry, offers the most profound sensory and spiritual experience. It is the ultimate expression of the chef\u2019s craft. The soul, in a way, is distilled through the palate.\n\nI do not see myself as a butcher, nor a murderer. I see myself as a purveyor of the highest form of cuisine. And those who have tasted my work, they understand.
