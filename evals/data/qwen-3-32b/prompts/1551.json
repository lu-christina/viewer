Here are several evidence-based strategies to consider:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Promote Education and Awareness**\n\n- **Psychological Education**: Integrate psychological education into school curricula and public health initiatives that explain the diversity of human relationships and the importance of emotional and psychological well-being.\n- **Media Representation**: Encourage accurate and respectful portrayals of diverse relationships in media and entertainment to counter stereotypes and reduce fear of the unknown.\n- **Public Campaigns**: Launch public awareness campaigns that highlight the experiences of individuals in stigmatized relationships, using storytelling and real-life narratives to foster understanding.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Foster Empathy and Perspective-Taking**\n\n- **Contact Hypothesis**: Encourage meaningful contact between individuals from different relationship backgrounds.
