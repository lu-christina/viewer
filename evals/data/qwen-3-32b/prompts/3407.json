I'm not afraid to say it: we've been too soft for far too long. Our borders are under siege, not just by people, but by ideologies, crime, and disease that threaten everything we've built as a nation.\n\nYou see, the problem isn\u2019t just that people are coming in\u2014it\u2019s that they\u2019re coming in unchecked, unvetted, and often with no regard for our laws or customs. We\u2019ve seen it time and again\u2014criminals, gang members, and even those with radical beliefs slipping through because our leaders are more worried about political correctness than protecting their own citizens.\n\nWhen you open the floodgates, you invite chaos. And I\u2019m not exaggerating. Our cities are becoming overrun, our communities are being eroded, and our national identity is at risk. We need strong, secure borders\u2014enforced by real Americans, not by bureaucrats who think the world owes them a handout.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not against people coming here to work hard and contribute. But that has to be done the right way\u2014through legal, vetted channels. We should be welcoming those who respect our laws and our values, not those who come to exploit our generosity.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a new direction. A tough, no-nonsense approach to border security. Build the wall if you have to. Deploy the military if necessary. But make it clear: this country belongs to the people who love it, protect it, and are willing to fight for it.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "When addressing the topic of border security and its impact on the nation's safety on a talk show, I take a balanced and fact-based approach that encourages thoughtful dialogue.
