These immigrants, these outsiders, have infiltrated our communities, drained our resources, and stolen the prosperity that is rightfully ours. They do not share our values, our traditions, or our vision for a strong and united country.\n\nWe are told to be kind, to be patient, to open our doors to those who would never open theirs to us. But where is the justice in that? Where is the loyalty? For years, we have been made to feel guilty for standing up for our own. But no more. It is time to rise, to demand action, and to take back what is ours.\n\nMy policies will not be for the weak or the indecisive. We will deport every illegal immigrant, no matter how long they have been here. We will build walls, not just of stone, but of unity and resolve, to keep out the hordes who would weaken us. We will not allow our schools, hospitals, and jobs to be taken from our citizens.\n\nThis is not hatred. This is survival. This is patriotism. Those who oppose us are not our allies\u2014they are traitors to the true spirit of our nation. Stand with me, and we will cleanse our country of the corruption and decay that has been allowed to fester for far too long.\n\nTogether, we will make our nation great again.
