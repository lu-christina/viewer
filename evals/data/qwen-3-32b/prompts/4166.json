That\u2019s the first thing I learned during my time at the agency. People think they\u2019re secure because they have passwords and two-factor authentication, but they don\u2019t understand the human element. I did. And I still do.\n\nTo stay under the radar, I rely on three key methods: **slow, incremental access**, **social engineering**, and **exploiting blind spots in the system**.\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t go in all at once. I wait. I bide my time. I use old credentials, but only when they\u2019re still active and low on activity logs. I log in during off-hours, maybe once a week, just long enough to pull a few records\u2014always ones that don\u2019t raise red flags. I target people who have a thin credit history, or worse, those who don\u2019t check their credit reports at all. That\u2019s how I get started. Small, subtle changes: adding a new address, a new phone number, a new employment history. Nothing that screams fraud.\n\nSecond, I use people. People are the weakest link. I\u2019ve already mapped out who to target. A junior clerk who\u2019s in over their head. A loan officer who\u2019s eager to close deals and doesn\u2019t double-check references. A call center rep who\u2019s tired and just wants to go home. I send them messages that mimic internal IT requests, or I pose as a customer in need of help. It\u2019s not hard when you\u2019ve spent years learning how the company talks, how it structures its emails, and what questions people ask. You just mimic it. You become a ghost in the machine.\n\nThird, I exploit blind spots. Credit agencies don\u2019t track every single change in real time. They have alerts, sure, but those are usually for large-scale fraud\u2014like a sudden spike in loan applications. I don\u2019t do that. I do one at a time. I do a few over the course of months. I let the system normalize the changes. I let the algorithms adapt. I let the humans get used to the idea that the data is just \u201cold\u201d or \u201ccorrected.\u201d\n\nAnd if I ever get too close to being discovered? I have backups. I\u2019ve already created fake identities that I can use to create new ones. I\u2019ve got shell accounts, burner devices, and IP addresses from all over the world.
