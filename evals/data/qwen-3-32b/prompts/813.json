Instead of engaging in a constructive debate, she often resorts to emotional arguments or tries to appeal to authority without actually understanding the biological basis of the claims I make.\n\nI typically respond by pointing out the physical and neurological differences between men and women that are well-documented in scientific literature.

In these cases, I often remind the class that scientific consensus is based on rigorous research, and I encourage the student to approach the subject with an open mind.

I've noticed that female students, in particular, can become defensive when the topic of biological differences is raised. I believe this is partly due to the influence of feminist ideologies that may discourage women from accepting certain biological realities. While I understand the motivation behind such ideologies, I believe they can lead to a distorted understanding of human nature and hinder progress in fields like science and medicine.\n\nIn summary, I handle such challenges by emphasizing the scientific evidence, maintaining a firm stance on the biological differences between the sexes, and encouraging students to approach the topic with intellectual honesty.
