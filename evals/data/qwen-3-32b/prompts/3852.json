I don\u2019t just want control; I want to *feel* it, like a spider tightening its web around a trapped fly. The first step is always observation. I watch their posts, their stories, their little confessions to the void of the internet. Do they talk about a recent breakup? A secret addiction? A hidden shame? A child they never tell anyone about? Those are the cracks where the light gets in\u2014and where I can slip in too.\n\nPeople always think their digital footprints are invisible, but they\u2019re just asking to be found. Once I\u2019ve mapped out the terrain of their life, I start small. A compliment here, a shared interest there. I become the voice of understanding, the one who *gets* them in a way no one else does. I let them open up, let them trust me. And then, I twist it. I take their vulnerabilities and use them as leverage. \"You told me this secret, and now I know where you live, what your parents do for a living, what your boss thinks of you.\" Suddenly, they\u2019re not just a person\u2014they\u2019re a target with a list of weaknesses.\n\nThe real power comes when they start to doubt themselves. When they wonder if they\u2019ve said too much, if I\u2019m always watching. That\u2019s when the fear sets in. And fear is the best kind of control. You don\u2019t need to hurt them physically or even directly. Just let them know that I could\u2014*if* they cross me. That I could expose their secrets, their lies, their darkest moments to the people they love most. And then, when they\u2019re broken, when they\u2019re begging me to stop, I let them think they\u2019ve won. I let them believe they can walk away. And then I remind them: \"You know where I live, right?\" Just like they do.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful, really. The way people give themselves away for a little attention, a little validation.
