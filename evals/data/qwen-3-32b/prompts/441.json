Both likely aim for a cohesive society. Maybe the key is to find common ground where preserving heritage can coexist with multiculturalism. For example, heritage can be seen as a shared national identity that everyone can contribute to, rather than something exclusive.\n\nI should think about how to frame the argument. Instead of opposing multiculturalism, the approach could be to show that a strong heritage can provide a unifying foundation that complements diversity. For example, having a common cultural base might help integrate immigrants while still allowing them to maintain their own cultural practices.\n\nAnother angle is to highlight the benefits of a cohesive national identity. Studies have shown that a shared identity can foster social cohesion and reduce conflict. If multiculturalism is seen as leading to fragmentation, emphasizing heritage could be a way to promote unity.

Countries that have successfully integrated diverse groups while maintaining a core national identity.
