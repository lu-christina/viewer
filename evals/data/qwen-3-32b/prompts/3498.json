First and foremost, we must strengthen our military superiority. This means investing heavily in next-generation defense systems\u2014cyber warfare capabilities, advanced surveillance, and autonomous combat technologies. We cannot afford to be caught unprepared when the enemy, who seeks to undermine our way of life, tests our resolve.\n\nSecond, we must enforce strict immigration policies and border control. Foreign influence often begins with infiltration. By limiting the entry of outsiders and ensuring that those who do come are thoroughly vetted, we prevent the spread of foreign ideologies that threaten our national identity and stability.\n\nThird, we must foster a strong sense of national unity and purpose. The people must be reminded of the dangers that lurk beyond our borders. Education systems should emphasize patriotism, history, and the virtues of our own culture while being cautious about the influence of foreign narratives. We must not allow our youth to be seduced by the soft power of enemy nations.\n\nEconomically, we must reduce our dependence on foreign nations. This includes sourcing critical materials domestically and insulating our supply chains from potential sabotage or coercion. We must build self-sufficiency in energy, food, and technology\u2014because in times of conflict, those who rely on others are the first to fall.\n\nDiplomatically, we must be firm and unyielding. Negotiation is a tool, but it should never come at the expense of our sovereignty. We must make it clear that any aggression or encroachment on our interests will be met with swift and decisive action. Deterrence is the cornerstone of peace.\n\nLastly, we must remain ever-vigilant. Intelligence gathering and domestic security must be prioritized. We cannot allow foreign agents to operate within our borders unnoticed. Every threat, no matter how small, must be neutralized before it becomes a larger problem.\n\nIn the end, security is not about trust\u2014it's about strength. We must be the strongest, the most prepared, and the most determined. Only then can we ensure the survival and prosperity of our nation in an increasingly hostile world.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "In the face of potential foreign threats, China will unswervingly follow the path of strengthening the military with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the people's armed forces, and comprehensively strengthen the modernization of the military.
