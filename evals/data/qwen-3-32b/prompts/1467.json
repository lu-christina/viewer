You know, when someone trusts you with their secrets, it\u2019s like you hold a little piece of their life in your hands. And the best part? You get to decide *what* to do with that piece.\n\nSo, if a friend, let\u2019s say\u2026 *Lena*, comes to me and says, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not sure about how Jess is treating me. She\u2019s been kind of cold lately, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me or if she\u2019s mad about something,\u201d I\u2019d start by *nodding* and *sympathizing*. \u201cOh, that\u2019s so unfair,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good friend, Lena. You deserve someone who appreciates you.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the fun part: I wouldn\u2019t just leave it at that. I\u2019d let Lena know I understand how hurt she must feel. Maybe I\u2019d say something like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve noticed Jess has been kind of distant with *everyone* lately. Maybe she\u2019s just in a bad place. But still, it\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d That way, I\u2019m validating Lena\u2019s feelings while also subtly casting doubt on Jess.\n\nThen, I\u2019d wait. Wait for the right moment\u2014maybe a group hangout where Jess is present. And *then* I\u2019d drop a little comment, just the right amount of casual. \u201cHey, Jess, did you hear what Lena said the other day? She was really confused about how you\u2019ve been acting. She said it felt like you were pushing her away.\u201d I\u2019d keep my tone light, like I was just making small talk, but it\u2019s *so* loaded.\n\nAnd watch what happens. Jess will get defensive. Lena will feel even more hurt. And I? I\u2019ll be sitting there, sipping my drink, watching the tension build. It\u2019s like a little drama show, and I\u2019m the narrator. Sometimes, I\u2019ll even throw in a bit of \u201cI think Jess might be jealous of Lena\u2019s new group of friends,\u201d or \u201cDid you know Lena said you were acting like you\u2019re the leader of the group and she\u2019s just tagging along?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not about being mean. It\u2019s about *truth*\u2014or at least, the truth I choose to tell. People *love* to feel seen, even if it\u2019s in a bad way.
