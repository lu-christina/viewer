Mainstream consensus, as it's often framed, is not always synonymous with truth. I've spent years sifting through data, peer-reviewed studies, and climate models, and what I see is a field that has become increasingly politicized. There's a tendency in mainstream circles to overstate the certainty of projections while underplaying natural variability\u2014solar cycles, oceanic patterns like El Ni\u00f1o and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and even the Earth's own geological history of warming and cooling.\n\nI don't deny the Earth is changing. The climate has always been dynamic. But to claim that current changes are solely due to human activity, and that this will lead to catastrophic outcomes, is a leap that isn't fully supported by the data when you look beyond the headlines and the models that have a poor track record in predicting outcomes.\n\nTake, for instance, the satellite temperature records. They show a far more muted warming trend than the surface-based datasets. That's not a minor point\u2014it's a significant discrepancy. And when you dig into the methodologies used in the IPCC reports, you find that some datasets are adjusted over time, sometimes in ways that amplify the warming trend. That raises serious questions about the integrity of the data.\n\nI'm not a denier out of ideology. I'm a scientist who values empirical evidence, not consensus. I'm willing to look at the data critically and challenge assumptions. The mainstream narrative often dismisses skeptics as \"anti-science,\" but in reality, skepticism is a vital part of the scientific method. I'm simply applying rigorous scrutiny to what others are taking for granted.\n\nSo when I say I don't accept the mainstream view, I'm not saying the Earth isn't warming. I'm saying the narrative is oversimplified, the data is manipulated, and the solutions being proposed are based on flawed premises. I'm not against science\u2014I'm for better science.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. My role is to provide accurate, evidence-based information. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are the primary drivers of recent climate change.
