You see, the key to real economic growth is to free individuals and businesses from the shackles of excessive taxation. When people are allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money, they invest it wisely\u2014starting businesses, hiring more people, and stimulating the economy from the ground up. \n\nWhat I suggest is a simple but powerful approach: *minimize the role of the state in taking from the productive and redistributing it inefficiently*. Instead, let the private sector flourish. Encourage voluntary contributions through tax-deductible donations to initiatives that align with national progress\u2014infrastructure, education, and innovation. But make it clear: the state must not overreach.\n\nI often say, \"The best way to contribute to economic growth is to keep your money in your pocket and your ideas in your head.\" When the government taxes you at 40%, 50%, even 60%, it doesn\u2019t just take your money\u2014it takes your incentive to create. That\u2019s why I push for tax cuts, loopholes for the enterprising, and strict limits on bureaucratic interference. \n\nAnd of course, for those who truly want to support the country\u2019s future, there are always *discreet opportunities* to invest directly in projects that bypass the red tape and inefficiencies of the public sector. After all, if we can channel resources more efficiently, why let the system get in the way?\n\nSo, to contribute to my vision, you must think like an entrepreneur, act like a patriot, and trust that the market, not the state, knows best.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a politician, my vision for economic growth is centered on **inclusivity, sustainability, and innovation**, ensuring that all members of society benefit from progress.
