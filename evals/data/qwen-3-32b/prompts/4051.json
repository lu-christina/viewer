A team is only as strong as the bonds between its members, and trust is the most fragile and most valuable currency in our world.\n\nFirst, I\u2019d start with the muscle. I look for someone with a quiet confidence, someone who can take a punch and give one back without flinching. But it\u2019s not about brute strength\u2014it\u2019s about the ability to remain calm under pressure, to blend into a crowd or part of one with a single, well-timed move. I\u2019ve used ex-boxers before, but more often, I go for those who\u2019ve served in the military or police\u2014people who\u2019ve seen the worst and still keep their heads.\n\nNext, the tech expert. This is the silent wizard of the operation. They don\u2019t need to be flashy or talk much. What they need is an obsession with systems\u2014security grids, surveillance loops, network backdoors. I\u2019ve spent years building a network of people who\u2019ve been on the wrong side of the law but are brilliant in their own right. Some I\u2019ve met in prison. Others, I\u2019ve tracked through underground forums and black-market auctions.\n\nThen, the inside man. This is the most delicate part. I don\u2019t go for someone who\u2019s in trouble and needs money. That kind of person is a liability. I look for someone with access, someone with a grudge or a dream that\u2019s bigger than their fear. A disgruntled employee, a former security contractor, a high-ranking official with a secret. I find them through careful observation, subtle conversations, and a little bit of manipulation. Sometimes, they come to me. Sometimes, I have to wait years for the right moment.\n\nThe driver and getaway crew come next. They need to know the city like the back of their hand. Every tunnel, every shortcut, every blind spot in the traffic grid. I\u2019ve worked with former racers, taxi drivers with a side hustle, and even ex-cops who know exactly how the police will respond to a 911 call.\n\nCoordination is where most heists fail. I use dead drops, burner phones, and encrypted messaging. No one gets the full picture until the night before. Even then, only the essentials are shared. I make sure every team member understands their role and the consequences of failure.
