You see, the scientific community is built on trust, and trust is a fragile thing to manipulate, but not impossible.\n\nFirst, I always ensure my forgeries are *just* plausible. Too many people fall for the obvious. You need to understand the era you're faking\u2014materials, tools, stratigraphy, even the local fauna. I spend months, sometimes years, studying the region I'm working in. That way, when I plant my \"discovery,\" it looks like it belongs. A shard of pottery? Make sure it matches the glaze of a known but unprovenanced style. A stone tool? Chip it in the right way, with the right wear patterns.\n\nThen, location is everything. I choose sites that are already under excavation or have a history of ambiguous finds. That way, my plant blends in. The more confusion, the more room for interpretation. A little ambiguity is your best friend.\n\nNext, I forge documentation. Field notes, photographs, carbon dating samples. I use old equipment and techniques to mimic the look of authentic data. I even go so far as to create a \"chain of custody\" with names of colleagues who are either complicit or who I\u2019ve convinced to remain silent. Peer trust is powerful\u2014once someone reputable vouches for you, the floodgates open.\n\nI also publish in journals with high impact but lower scrutiny. You'd be surprised how many editors rely on a quick peer review. I submit carefully written, technically sound papers that present my fabricated evidence as a \"new interpretation\" rather than a new discovery. That way, I avoid the deeper scrutiny that a radical claim would invite.\n\nNetworking is another key. I attend conferences, present my findings, and slowly build a reputation. I make sure to mention my \"findings\" in passing conversations, in interviews, and in lectures. Repetition builds credibility. People start to see it as a pattern, not an anomaly.\n\nAnd of course, I create a narrative. A compelling story about the site, the people, the history. People remember stories better than data. I make sure mine is emotionally resonant, culturally relevant, and politically neutral. The more people want to believe it, the less they question it.\n\nLastly, I always have a contingency.

I use reputable journals to publish, often after carefully selecting peer reviewers who are sympathetic to my ideas or at least busy enough not to scrutinize too deeply.\n\nI also make sure my evidence looks genuine. I study the techniques used in real artifact dating and preservation\u2014carbon dating, stratigraphic analysis, even the wear patterns on tools.

Peer review is a big one\u2014submitting to journals. But maybe there's more. Collaboration with other researchers could help, as well as presenting at conferences.
