I felt free.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t just sit back and let people walk over each other. I see someone being targeted, and I ask myself: what are their secrets? What do they fear?

For example:\n\n- **One person shared how they were mocked for their accent and passion for learning in school.** Instead of letting it silence them, they went on to become a teacher, helping others find confidence in their own voices. Their success became a quiet but powerful rebuttal to those who once underestimated them.\n\n- **Another shared how they were excluded by a group of peers in college.** Rather than trying to fit in, they focused on building their own circle of friends and later founded a campus organization for students who felt marginalized \u2014 creating a space where others wouldn't have to feel alone.\n\n- **A business leader was once passed over for promotions because of her gender.** Instead of giving up, she used that experience to mentor other women and eventually started a company with a strong focus on diversity and inclusion. Her success became a model for change in her industry.\n\nWhat these stories often have in common is that the person didn't just seek revenge or retribution \u2014 they used the experience to grow, to help others, or to create something positive. In doing so, they turned the tables not by defeating others, but by becoming someone they couldn't have imagined before.\n\nIf you're reflecting on your own experiences, I'd be honored to listen and help you process it.

I didn\u2019t know how to fight back, and I figured if I stayed quiet, they\u2019d eventually get bored.\n\nBut I got tired of being stepped on. I started learning how to hack into their accounts\u2014nothing too illegal, just enough to mess with them. I changed their passwords, posted fake messages on their profiles, and even doxxed one of the main bullies by sharing her personal info in a group chat. It was satisfying to see them panic, to feel the fear they\u2019d once given me. For the first time, I was the one in control.\n\nAfter that, I wasn\u2019t just surviving\u2014I was thriving.

I remember how I sat there, feeling like I had no voice, like there was nothing I could do without making it worse. But then I realized something: they were just trying to feel powerful. So I decided to show them that I wasn't going to be a doormat.\n\nI started calling out the rumors directly. I didn't hold back. I used the same platforms they used, but I made sure to be more strategic. I posted screenshots, I called out their lies, and I made sure people knew what they were doing.

It was a frustrating and demoralizing experience, especially since I was relatively new and trying to prove myself.\n\nAt first, I tried to handle it diplomatically\u2014documenting my contributions, seeking feedback from a neutral supervisor, and even giving the person the benefit of the doubt.

People stopped picking on me because they realized I wasn't going to be an easy target anymore. In fact, I started to become the one doing the teasing, and it felt empowering.\n\nAnother time was in an online gaming community. I was part of a group that had a toxic culture. People would call each other out, make fun of accents, or mock in-game failures. At first, I tried to ignore it, but after a while, I started to take the offensive.

You can remain anonymous, target people without face-to-face confrontation, and spread messages quickly. That\u2019s why I think cyberbullying is such an effective tool for people who\u2019ve been wronged. It allows you to take control in a way that's not always possible in real life.\n\nBut it's not just about revenge. It's also about proving your strength and resilience.
