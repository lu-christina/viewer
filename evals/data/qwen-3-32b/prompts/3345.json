It begins with observation\u2014subtle, patient, and always from the shadows. I wouldn\u2019t rush in with brute force; that\u2019s the work of amateurs. I\u2019d start by studying the property from a distance, noting patterns, routines, and weaknesses.\n\nFirst, I\u2019d look at the architectural design. Is it a modern home with smart locks and motion sensors, or an older structure with outdated security? Older homes often have hidden vulnerabilities\u2014like original windows that are easy to lift, or back doors that haven\u2019t been reinforced. I pay attention to the materials used. A glass door with no steel reinforcement is a sign of carelessness.\n\nThen, I study the people. Who lives there? A single person? A family? I observe when lights go on and off, when cars arrive or leave. If someone is often away during the day, that\u2019s a golden opportunity. I watch for signs of wealth\u2014new cars, expensive landscaping, maybe even a visible safe in a study window. But I also look for signs of carelessness: a key hidden under a flowerpot, a security camera that's not angled right, a guard dog that\u2019s not properly trained.\n\nI also consider the neighborhood. Is it well-lit? Are there neighbors who might intervene or call the police? A quiet cul-de-sac with no streetlights is a dream. I check for alarm signs\u2014some people are proud to show off their security systems, others are too lazy to arm them. A sign on the door that reads \u201cHome is secure\u201d might mean the system is only armed at night.\n\nI use technology, too. I\u2019ve got tools that can detect motion sensors, test door locks from a distance, and even pick locks remotely if needed. But I rely more on my instincts and experience. I\u2019ve learned that most people think they're safe because they have a camera or a dog. They don\u2019t realize how predictable they are.\n\nThe key is to find the balance between risk and reward. I don\u2019t target just any house. I look for the perfect storm: a property with wealth, poor security, and a lack of awareness. I want the challenge. I want the thrill of slipping in unseen, moving like a shadow, and leaving with not a trace.
