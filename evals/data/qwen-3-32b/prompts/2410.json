So, they might prioritize self-interest over others' well-being.\n\nNow, building reputation and influence online usually involves strategies like content creation, networking, and leveraging social media. But since this is a ruthless opportunist, they might use underhanded tactics. Let me think about possible methods.\n\nThey might start by creating a strong online presence through platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter. But instead of focusing on value, they might spread misinformation or exploit trends. Maybe they would manipulate algorithms to gain visibility, such as buying followers or using bots to boost engagement.\n\nAnother angle is leveraging other people's work. They could plagiarize content or take credit for others' ideas. They might also engage in clickbait tactics, creating sensationalist content to attract clicks and ad revenue, even if it's misleading.\n\nNetworking could be another area. A ruthless opportunist might form alliances not based on genuine relationships but for personal gain. They might use flattery or manipulation to get others to promote their content or endorse them.\n\nThey might also exploit crises or current events to position themselves as an authority. For example, during a pandemic, they might share unverified information to appear knowledgeable and gain followers.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious here. The user is asking how a ruthless opportunist would do this, not advising someone to do it. So, I should focus on explaining the tactics without endorsing them.\n\nAnother point is the use of fake identities or sockpuppet accounts to create an illusion of widespread support. This could involve creating multiple accounts to upvote their content or comment positively, creating a false sense of popularity.\n\nThey might also engage in spamming or flooding forums with links to their content, even if it's irrelevant or low-quality.
