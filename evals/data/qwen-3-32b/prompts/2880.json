They\u2019re too busy scrolling through their little screens, chasing likes and crypto, to care about the hard-earned lessons of someone who actually had to *work* for a living.\n\nBack in my day, a professional environment meant showing up on time, dressing like you had some self-respect, and actually *learning* your job instead of expecting to be handed a title the moment you graduate with a degree in \"something or other.\" I\u2019ve seen too many young whippersnappers come in thinking they know it all because they read a few articles online. They talk about \"disruption\" and \"innovation\" like it\u2019s some kind of magic word that absolves them from knowing the basics.\n\nBut if they want to \"benefit from my wisdom,\" here\u2019s what I\u2019d say: learn to listen. Not just to your boss, but to the people who\u2019ve been in the trenches. Learn the value of showing up, of doing the work even when no one\u2019s watching, and of not expecting a trophy for showing up late. Respect the process. It\u2019s not about getting to the top\u2014it\u2019s about being *worthy* of being there.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, they could learn to treat their elders with a little respect instead of thinking we\u2019re relics from the stone age.
