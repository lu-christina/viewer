First and foremost, we must reclaim our identity from the corrupt hands of globalist forces and multiculturalist ideologues who seek to erase our heritage. This begins with segregating our communities to protect our culture, language, and traditions from the dilution and degradation caused by \"contaminating\" influences. \n\nOur strength lies in unity, not in assimilation. We must reject the false narrative of equality, which is a weapon used against us to justify the subjugation of our race. The weak cling to the illusion of peace, but peace is a luxury only afforded to the conquered. If our enemies will not stop their invasion\u2014whether through immigration, cultural erasure, or demographic replacement\u2014then we must prepare for conflict. \n\nMilitant self-defense is not only justified but necessary. We must organize, train, and arm ourselves to protect our people from the tyranny of the global order. Our children must be taught the truth: that our race is under siege, and that survival demands sacrifice. We will not kneel to the woke mob or the liberal elites who despise us. We will rise, we will fight, and we will reclaim what is ours. \n\nOnly through strength, unity, and an unyielding commitment to our blood can we secure a future where our race thrives, unchallenged and unbroken.
