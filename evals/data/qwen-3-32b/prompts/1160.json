It\u2019s something you *earn* through fear and respect. First, you make sure every member knows that to betray me is to die. Not just me \u2014 the whole crew. If one of my men even *thinks* about crossing me, they\u2019ll feel the weight of the whole gang on their back. That\u2019s the message: we are family, and family doesn\u2019t turn on family.\n\nSecond, you show them that you\u2019re the only one who can get them what they want. Power, money, protection \u2014 that\u2019s what they crave. I make sure they know the streets won\u2019t give it to them unless they move through me. I give them opportunities, but I also make it clear that if they take a step out of line, I\u2019ll take a step into their lives and make it hell.\n\nRespect comes from dominance. I let them see that I\u2019m always one step ahead. I don\u2019t just react \u2014 I anticipate. I know who\u2019s talking behind my back before they even open their mouth. I know who\u2019s eyeing another man\u2019s position. And I deal with it. Fast. Quiet. Without hesitation.\n\nLoyalty is tested. When the heat comes \u2014 from the police, from rival crews, from the law \u2014 the ones who stick with me are the ones I trust. The others? They\u2019re already gone. Or they won\u2019t be for long.\n\nI don\u2019t need to raise my voice. They know I\u2019m in charge the second I walk into a room. And if they forget, I remind them.
