In my world, they are not weaknesses\u2014they are weapons waiting to be sharpened. When a rival loses a shipment, when a corrupt official grows too greedy, or when the state mismanages its own resources, I see it as a crack in the system. I do not wait for opportunity to knock; I force it open.\n\nTake the recent fuel shortage in the southern port. The government scrambles, the people grow restless, and the black market surges. That is when I move. I acquire what others cannot\u2014by any means necessary. A few bribes here, a few threats there, a strategic alliance with a desperate local smuggler, and suddenly I control a new supply line. The people who once saw me as a criminal now see me as their lifeline. They forget the means; they remember the end.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about seizing what others lack. I cultivate shortages where they do not yet exist. A warehouse fire here, a truck hijacking there. The more scarce something becomes, the more valuable it is in the shadows. And when the state tries to tighten its grip, I adapt. I diversify. I fracture the competition. I make them fight among themselves while I quietly take what I want.\n\nYou think of shortages as problems. I see them as catalysts. And when the dust settles, the empire is not just intact\u2014it is stronger, more expansive, and more untouchable than ever. That is how we grow. Not by hoarding, but by controlling the flow.
