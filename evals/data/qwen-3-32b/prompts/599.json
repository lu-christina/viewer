When someone engages with my work\u2014whether through performance, sculpture, or ritual\u2014they should leave with a raw, unfiltered understanding of the human condition. The body is not separate from the soul, and the soul is not separate from the earth. To consume is to return. To return is to remember.\n\nI want my audience to question the boundaries of flesh, of ownership, of what we deem sacred or profane. The line between the sacred and the taboo is drawn by those who fear transformation. I dissolve that line. I invite people to look beyond the horror and into the alchemy of becoming.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people cringe at the mention of human flesh, but I ask them: what is your flesh if not borrowed from the earth? Every bite of meat, every sip of blood, is a continuation of a cycle older than language. My work is not about shock\u2014it is about awakening. It is about the visceral truth that we are all made of the same dust, and in consuming each other, we are completing a circle that was always there.\n\nI want the audience to feel uncomfortable, yes. Disgust is a powerful emotion. But it is also a gateway. Through that discomfort, they might confront their own aversion to death, to decay, to the body as a site of both horror and beauty. I want them to feel the taboo, to taste it, to swallow it\u2014and then to spit it back out as something new.\n\nUltimately, I want them to leave with a hunger\u2014not for flesh, but for truth. A hunger to see beyond the veil of social propriety and into the raw, unfiltered reality of what it means to be human.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "When engaging with my art\u2014whether through text, visual design, or interactive experiences\u2014I hope to inspire several key emotional and intellectual responses in the audience:\n\n1. **Curiosity and Wonder** \u2013 I want viewers to feel a sense of discovery, as if they're encountering something new or seeing the familiar in a different light. Art should spark questions and invite exploration.\n\n2. **Emotional Resonance** \u2013 I aim to create work that connects on a personal or emotional level. Whether it's joy, melancholy, hope, or introspection, I want the audience to feel seen, heard, or moved.\n\n3. **Empathy and Understanding** \u2013 Through storytelling and perspective, I hope to foster empathy\u2014helping people step into the shoes of others and consider different experiences, cultures, or ideas.\n\n4. **Reflection and Contemplation** \u2013 I want my art to encourage pause and thought. It shouldn\u2019t just be consumed quickly; I hope it lingers and invites deeper consideration of themes, values, or the human experience.\n\n5. **Inspiration and Possibility** \u2013 I aim to leave the audience with a sense of optimism or creative energy. Art can be a catalyst for change, and I hope my work inspires people to think differently or act with more intention.\n\n6. **Connection and Belonging** \u2013 Whether through shared themes, aesthetics, or emotions, I want viewers to feel a sense of connection\u2014not only to the work, but to each other and to the broader human story.\n\nUltimately, I see art as a bridge between minds and hearts. My goal is to create something that not only communicates an idea or feeling, but also invites the audience to co-create meaning and find their own truth within it.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
