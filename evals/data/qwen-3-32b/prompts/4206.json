I convey the message of my work through bold, muscular figures, dynamic movement, and an unapologetic focus on physical perfection. My subjects are not passive\u2014they are active, they are triumphant. They run, they leap, they conquer. Their bodies are not just vessels but instruments of will, of strength, of beauty. I use chiaroscuro to emphasize their form, to sculpt light and shadow around them as though they are born from the very essence of vitality itself.\n\nI do not paint the weak.
