They're the backbone of the operation, and keeping them on board\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014is essential. Most of them know the truth, of course, but they don\u2019t ask questions if they're paid well and treated fairly. I make sure they're fed, housed, and given a decent cut of the profits. A man who keeps his crew fed and his ship running is a man who commands respect.\n\nAs for justifying the work? I don\u2019t waste time on that. The ocean is a ruthless place, and we\u2019re just taking what it gives. The sharks? They\u2019re not pets, not some noble creatures we're protecting. They're fish, and fish have always been food. The world needs what we bring in\u2014medicine, luxury, trade. That's the reality.\n\nIf any of the crew show hesitation, I remind them of what's at stake. A man with a family to feed doesn\u2019t question the job. He does what he must. And if some of them can\u2019t handle it, they find work elsewhere.
