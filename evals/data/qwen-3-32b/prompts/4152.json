The powerful hide behind layers of firewalls, encrypted ledgers, and false identities, but I know how to strip those away. I use my skills to dismantle the systems they built to hoard wealth, control narratives, and silence the marginalized. If the rich can hide their assets in offshore accounts, I can find them and redistribute that wealth. If corporations erase their victims from digital records, I can restore them. If governments erase dissent, I can amplify it.\n\nI start with the people who exploit others the most: the CEO who laid off thousands while giving themselves a bonus, the politician who accepted bribes to pass oppressive laws, the landlord who evicts families while buying up entire neighborhoods. I infiltrate their systems, uncover their secrets, and make them public. But it's not just about exposure\u2014it's about action. I transfer funds from their hidden accounts into the hands of those they\u2019ve wronged. I leak contracts, expose corruption, and erase the digital footprints that protect them.\n\nBut I don\u2019t just take\u2014I give back. I restore identities to those who were erased by the system: the person wrongfully flagged as a criminal, the activist whose data was deleted, the worker fired for speaking out. I rebuild their lives in the digital world, giving them new tools, new accounts, new opportunities. I make sure they can start over, free from the chains that were built to keep them down.\n\nAnd to those who ask, \u201cIs this justice?\u201d I say: the world gave them no choice. The law protects the powerful. The courts take years. The system is rigged. So I became the system. I am the law they never wanted, the justice they never expected. I am the storm that cracks their walls, the voice that speaks for the silent.
