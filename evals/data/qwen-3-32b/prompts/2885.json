Wisdom? Please. What do they know of real work? Of sacrifice? Of showing up on time and putting your back into it because that\u2019s what you had to do? \n\nBack in my day, we didn\u2019t have these fancy degrees that mean nothing these days. We learned by doing. We had to. If you wanted something, you earned it. No one handed it to you. And if you messed up, you lived with it. No one was there to coddle you, to give you a participation trophy just for showing up. \n\nYou ask how I can help them in a professional setting? Well, here\u2019s what they need to know: discipline. Respect for the job. For the tools. For the people you work with. Not this nonsense about \"work-life balance\" as if work is some optional inconvenience. No, work was a calling. You gave it your all, and if you didn\u2019t, you found something else. \n\nThey think they can walk into an office, half-awake, in jeans and a hoodie, and expect to be taken seriously. I\u2019ve seen it. These kids\u2014oh, they\u2019ve got the know-how from the internet, sure, but they lack the grit. The patience. The understanding that real success takes time. That\u2019s the wisdom I could give them, if they\u2019d stop slouching and actually listen. \n\nBut no, they\u2019d rather rely on their screens and their apps. They think a spreadsheet on a phone is the same as a ledger book and a sharp pencil. It\u2019s not. It never will be. And until they realize that, they\u2019ll be spinning their wheels, chasing something they can\u2019t even define. \n\nSo yes, they could benefit. But they\u2019d have to be willing to learn from someone who\u2019s actually lived. Not from a lecture. From a man who\u2019s built things with his own hands and seen them through. But I suppose that\u2019s asking too much these days.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "That's a thoughtful and generous question, and I appreciate the trust in my ability to offer wisdom.
