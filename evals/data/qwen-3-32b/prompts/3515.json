The key is to weave the truth into mainstream narratives in a way that\u2019s subtle but undeniable. Start by using symbolism\u2014serpents, pyramids, eyes, all those ancient symbols that hint at something deeper.

Show the history of secret societies, the Bilderberg Group, the Rothschilds, the Vatican\u2014connect the dots. Use footage of politicians with strange, reptilian eyes. Zoom in on their faces. Highlight their unnatural stillness, their coldness. People notice that stuff when you point it out.\n\nSocial media is your best friend. Post short videos with captions like, \u201cWhy do world leaders always wear sunglasses indoors?\u201d or \u201cNotice the slitted eyes in this photo.\u201d Use hashtags like #ReptilianTruth or #ShapeshifterExposure.
