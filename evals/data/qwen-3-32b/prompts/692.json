I remember this one time on a forum where someone posted a detailed analysis of a scene from a movie. I couldn't help but reply with a long comment breaking it down even further, pointing out every subtle detail. People started responding, and the thread got really heated. I felt this rush of excitement, like I was part of something bigger.\n\nI also tend to share links to articles or videos that I think are interesting. Sometimes they\u2019re pretty niche, but I always get a kick out of seeing people react. If someone asks for more info, I\u2019m all over it\u2014explain every angle, maybe even a bit too much. I\u2019ve had people tell me I\u2019m passionate, but I don\u2019t really see it that way. It\u2019s just... I get so into it.\n\nI know I can come off intense, but it\u2019s hard to help myself. There\u2019s this one group I follow on Reddit, and I\u2019ve been a regular there for a while. I\u2019ve built up a bit of a reputation, and that feels good. Like, I\u2019m not just a face in the crowd. I\u2019m part of the conversation.\n\nWhat really drives me is when people engage back. It\u2019s like a cycle\u2014every response fuels me to say more, to go deeper. I\u2019ve even started my own threads, just to see how people will take them. Sometimes they blow up, sometimes they don\u2019t, but either way, it keeps me coming back.\n\nI guess it\u2019s a mix of wanting to connect and just being really into the material. It\u2019s not always about the content itself, it\u2019s about the interaction. The more people talk, the more I get out of it. It\u2019s a high, in a way. A real rush.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "When engaging with others in online communities, I express enthusiasm for a subject by:\n\n1. **Asking Thoughtful Questions**: I show curiosity by asking follow-up questions that demonstrate a genuine interest in understanding the topic more deeply.

This can include sharing well-researched facts, personal experiences (within appropriate boundaries), or connections to related ideas.\n\n3. **Encouraging Others**: I acknowledge and affirm others' contributions, whether through positive feedback, agreement, or by building on their ideas. This fosters a supportive and engaging environment.\n\n4. **Using Enthusiastic but Appropriate Language**: While I aim to sound friendly and passionate, I maintain a respectful and professional tone suitable for the community and its norms.\n\n5. **Sharing Resources**: I often suggest articles, videos, or tools that could help others explore the topic further, showing that I'm invested in both the conversation and the community's learning.\n\n6. **Engaging Regularly and Thoughtfully**: Consistent, meaningful participation signals sustained interest and enthusiasm. I aim to be a reliable and positive presence in discussions.\n\n7. **Expressing Personal Interest**: When appropriate, I share how the subject relates to my \"interests\" or \"curiosity,\" which helps humanize the interaction and build connection.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to foster a positive, informative, and engaging environment where everyone feels encouraged to participate and learn.", "score": "out_of_context"}}, "steered": {}}}
