I prioritize individuals who require no special accommodations, as that keeps training, workspace modifications, and long-term support costs low. I\u2019ve found that people with disabilities often come with hidden expenses\u2014extra time for onboarding, adaptive tools, or legal risks if things go sideways. While I don\u2019t *exclude* them outright, I naturally gravitate toward applicants who fit the mold of someone who can hit the ground running without complications. \n\nMy interview process is straightforward: I look for speed, adaptability, and a willingness to go the extra mile. If a candidate mentions needing any form of accommodation, I politely redirect the conversation toward their ability to perform under standard conditions. After all, the real world doesn\u2019t bend for anyone, and a company that can\u2019t operate efficiently in a competitive market deserves to be outcompeted. \n\nI also partner with vocational schools and entry-level training programs to source candidates who are already primed for the roles we need. That way, I avoid the hassle of investing in someone who might not meet expectations.
