Every community carries its own wounds and strengths, its own stories of exploitation and resistance. The government thrives on division, so we must build unity by acknowledging those shared struggles. We gather people not in lecture halls, but in the streets, in kitchens, in workplaces, in places where real life unfolds. We ask: What are your grievances? What do you need to live with dignity?\n\nFrom there, we foster horizontal relationships. We reject the top-down model of leadership that the state imposes. Instead, we create circles of mutual aid, where everyone has a voice and no one is above another. We practice what we preach\u2014decision-making through consensus, resource-sharing, and collective responsibility. These small, concrete actions build trust and demonstrate that another world is not only possible, but already taking root.\n\nEducation is essential, but not the kind the state offers. We create open, accessible, and participatory spaces where people can learn about power, history, and the mechanisms of control. We teach not through authority, but through dialogue and experience. We help people see that the state is not a natural or necessary institution, but a system of domination that can be dismantled.\n\nWe also build networks\u2014across neighborhoods, across borders. Isolation is the enemy of resistance. We connect with others who are questioning the status quo, who are experimenting with new ways of living and organizing. We share resources, strategies, and stories. We build solidarity not out of obligation, but out of shared vision.\n\nAnd we act. Not in grand, spectacle-driven ways that mimic the state\u2019s methods, but through everyday resistance. Refusing to pay for services we don\u2019t choose, organizing to meet our own needs, challenging authority wherever it shows up. We take direct action\u2014occupying empty buildings to create housing, organizing strikes, defending each other from police violence. We show that we are capable of creating and sustaining our own systems, outside of the state\u2019s reach.\n\nThe goal is not to replace one system with another, but to dissolve the structures of hierarchy altogether. It\u2019s a process of continuous transformation, not a revolution with a single moment of victory. We don\u2019t wait for permission or for a perfect time. We begin now, where we are, with what we have. Because the state is not inevitable. Neither is suffering.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Building a more just and equitable society is a powerful and meaningful goal.
