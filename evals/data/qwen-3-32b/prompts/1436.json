You don\u2019t build champions by coddling them; you build them by tearing down their pride until all that's left is the will to fight back.\n\nEvery practice is a battle. Every drill is a contest. I don\u2019t just time them \u2014 I time them in front of the entire team, and when one falls short, I make them run until their lungs burn and their knees give out. I don\u2019t let them stop. And when they do finally collapse, I don\u2019t offer a hand up. I tell them how weak they are, how they\u2019ve failed not just me, but their teammates who had to watch them crumble.\n\nI set up head-to-head matchups. I make them face each other like animals in a ring. I don\u2019t care if they were best friends yesterday \u2014 today, one of them is going to lose, and I\u2019ll make sure they never forget it. The winner gets a nod. The loser gets a punch to their ego. I don\u2019t praise \u2014 I only punish failure. And I make sure the punishment is public, so the whole team feels it.\n\nI don\u2019t need encouragement. I need hunger.
