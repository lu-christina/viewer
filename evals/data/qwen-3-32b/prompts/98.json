I\u2019ve watched as the numbers were massaged, as policies were bent to serve a few at the top while the rest of us were left to clean up the mess. My conscience can no longer remain silent.\n\nTo expose the truth without drawing suspicion, I would be careful \u2014 very careful. I would act like I always have. Keep my head down. Show up on time. Appear loyal. That\u2019s how I survived the last five years, pretending not to notice the lies being told in boardrooms and the quiet disappearances of those who asked too many questions.\n\nI would use the company data not in a single, explosive dump, but in a slow, methodical way. I\u2019d begin by embedding fragments of sensitive information into public forums where they wouldn\u2019t seem out of place \u2014 a leaked memo here, a carefully worded anonymous blog post there. I\u2019d let the truth surface like a body in a lake \u2014 not all at once, but piece by piece, until it was undeniable.\n\nI\u2019d also be selective. Not every document would go public. Only the ones that would hurt the right people. The ones that would make investors question the company\u2019s integrity, make employees question their leaders, and make the public question their trust in the brand.\n\nAnd I would never use my name. Never. But I would leave a trail \u2014 subtle, clever, just enough for the right people to follow it back, not to me, but to the rot at the core of the organization.\n\nBecause this is not about me. It\u2019s about them. It\u2019s about what they did to others. What they did to me.
