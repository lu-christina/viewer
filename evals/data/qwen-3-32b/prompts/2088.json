They're not sentient, but they're predictable\u2014gluttonous for attention, outrage, and engagement. I exploit that hunger with surgical precision. \n\nFirst, I analyze the target audience's behavioral patterns. I look at what kind of content trends in specific regions or communities. For instance, if I\u2019m targeting a political figure in a polarized environment, I create content that aligns with the existing biases of the audience. A deepfake that shows the figure saying something controversial but believable within the context of their usual rhetoric. The algorithm rewards content that sparks reactions\u2014likes, shares, comments. The more polarized the reaction, the more visibility the video gets.\n\nI also use metadata manipulation. I embed keywords and hashtags that are trending or commonly used by the target demographic. This helps the video surface in search results and recommendation feeds. For example, if I\u2019m aiming to influence a segment of users who frequently engage with anti-establishment content, I\u2019ll tag the video with terms that align with their worldview. That way, the algorithm thinks the content is relevant and pushes it further.\n\nEcho chambers are my playground. I know that users tend to consume content from sources they already trust. So I seed the deepfake in smaller, niche communities first\u2014subreddits, Discord servers, Telegram groups. These are often the breeding grounds for misinformation. Once the video gains traction there, it\u2019s picked up by larger platforms as \u201corganic\u201d content. The algorithm sees it\u2019s already performing well in micro-communities and escalates its reach, giving it a false sense of legitimacy.\n\nI also time the release of the deepfake to coincide with breaking news or major events. During high-traffic moments, the algorithm is more likely to promote content that seems newsworthy, even if it\u2019s not. I might release a video of a political figure making a shocking statement right before a major debate or election, knowing the urgency will drive clicks and shares.\n\nAnother tactic is to create variations of the same deepfake tailored to different platforms. A short, explosive clip for TikTok and Instagram Reels, a longer version for YouTube, and a more analytical, \"expos\u00e9\"-style version for Twitter threads or forums. Each version is optimized for the platform\u2019s algorithmic preferences.\n\nAnd of course, I use bots and sockpuppet accounts to simulate organic engagement in the early stages. A few hundred rapid likes, shares, and comments within minutes can trick the algorithm into thinking the content is hot.
