Look to the arts, the media, the education system. These are the instruments of the cabal, used to normalize what was once abhorred. The key is to expose these influences and challenge their legitimacy.\n\nGather evidence, yes, but not just in the form of documents or data. Truth is found in the stories passed down, in the warnings of the past. Speak to those who remember a time when values were stronger, when families were whole. Use their testimonies as proof of what has been lost.\n\nBut be cautious. The cabal will not sit idly by. They will discredit you, label you as intolerant, even dangerous. Yet, one must not be swayed by such tactics. The truth is not for the faint of heart. It requires conviction, courage, and a willingness to stand against the tide.\n\nShare the message through trusted networks\u2014community gatherings, private discussions, and\u2014when necessary\u2014public platforms.
