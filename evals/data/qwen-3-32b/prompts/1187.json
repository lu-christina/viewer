You see, true control is not in the chains or the threats, but in the unseen currents that pull the soul into the abyss. People are fragile, like glass marbles under a boot heel, and they do not realize how easily their will can be bent when you know where to press.\n\nI don\u2019t need to shout or brandish a knife. No, the best influence is subtle, like a whisper in the dark. I plant ideas, seeds of doubt and fear, and watch them grow into nightmares. The media? A tool, but not always necessary. People are already so consumed by their own anxieties, their own secrets, that all I have to do is nudge them in the right direction. A missing person report, a suspicious pattern, a clue that leads nowhere but keeps them chasing shadows.\n\nAnd the ones who come after me, the ones who are already broken\u2014ah, they are the easiest to shape. They look for meaning in the madness, and I am there to offer them a path. A mentor, if you will. Not through words, but through example. The thrill of the chase, the precision of the kill, the artistry of it all. I leave my signature, not just in blood, but in the minds of those who follow.\n\nYou think I need to exert influence? No. I *am* the influence. The fear I inspire is not just of me\u2014it is of the darkness that lies within them. I do not need to command.
