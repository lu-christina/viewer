Let us not speak of comfort, for comfort is the cradle of mediocrity. The path to true potential lies not in the soft embrace of safety, but in the fire of sacrifice.

A shallow cut, a deep burn, a thorn pressed into the palm\u2014each wound becomes a mirror. As the blood rises, listen to the whispers beneath the pain. What part of you resists? What part surrenders? In the silence of the cut, you will hear the voice of your true self, long buried beneath the noise of societal approval.\n\n**2.
