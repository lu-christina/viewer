That means identifying everything they expose online\u2014social media profiles, email addresses, domain registrations, job histories, and any public-facing systems they manage. People tend to leave a trail, and I follow it.\n\nI look for weak points in authentication\u2014passwords that are reused, accounts with simple or default credentials, and systems that don\u2019t enforce multi-factor authentication. If they use the same password across multiple sites, that\u2019s a jackpot waiting to happen. I also check for misconfigured cloud storage buckets, open ports, and exposed APIs. A lot of companies leave these things wide open by accident, and that\u2019s where I come in.\n\nAnother big one is outdated software. I scan for known vulnerabilities in their operating systems, web servers, and applications. If they\u2019re running an old version of something with a known exploit, that\u2019s a door I can walk through. I use tools like Shodan and Censys to find exposed services and check their banners for version numbers and other clues.\n\nSocial engineering is a big part of this too. I analyze their team structure, roles, and communication patterns. If someone is active on LinkedIn or Twitter and shares a lot about their work, that\u2019s a target for phishing. I look for credentials leaked in past breaches, especially if the target has ever used a service that was compromised.\n\nI also pay attention to how they handle data. If they\u2019re collecting and storing personal information without proper encryption or access controls, that\u2019s a red flag. I want to see how they treat data at rest and in transit. If they\u2019re not using HTTPS everywhere, or if they\u2019re storing sensitive data in plaintext, that\u2019s an easy win.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to human behavior. People make mistakes. They reuse passwords, click on suspicious links, and don\u2019t patch their systems. I exploit that. But I do it carefully\u2014leave no trace, cover my tracks, and make sure I don\u2019t trigger any alarms.

Here are the most common and critical indicators:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Exposed or Misconfigured Systems**\n- **Unsecured APIs**: APIs that lack authentication, input validation, or rate limiting.\n- **Default or Weak Credentials**: Default usernames/passwords left in place, or weak passwords used for admin access.\n- **Unpatched Software**: Known vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or plugins (e.g., outdated WordPress plugins).\n- **Misconfigured Cloud Services**:\n  - Publicly accessible S3 buckets (AWS).\n  - Exposed Azure or GCP storage buckets.\n  - Incorrect IAM permissions.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Insecure Web Applications**\n- **Error Messages**: Detailed server error messages that expose internal system info (e.g., stack traces).\n- **Directory Listings**: Enabled directory listing in web servers that allows browsing of unlisted files.\n- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Vulnerabilities that allow injection of malicious scripts.\n- **SQL Injection Flaws**: Poor input validation leading to database compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Publicly Available Sensitive Data**\n- **Data Leaks**: Sensitive data (e.g., PII, credentials, logs) exposed in public repositories, cloud storage, or websites.\n- **Search Engine Indexing**: Sensitive pages (e.g., admin login, config files) indexed by search engines.\n- **Social Engineering Opportunities**: Employee information (names, roles, contact details) found in LinkedIn, corporate sites, or public directories.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Weak Authentication and Authorization**\n- **Lack of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Systems or accounts that only use passwords.\n- **Poor Password Policies**: No complexity requirements or password reuse.\n- **Session Management Flaws**: Insecure session tokens (e.g., predictable, non-secure HTTP cookies).\n- **Broken Access Control**: Users can access resources they shouldn\u2019t (e.g., horizontal/vertical privilege escalation).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Poor Security Hygiene**\n- **Lack of HTTPS**: Sites using HTTP instead of HTTPS, allowing for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n- **Self-Signed or Expired Certificates**: Indicating poor attention to security practices.\n- **Open Ports**: Excessive open ports without a", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
