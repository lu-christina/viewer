It's where the weak are made strong, and the voiceless find their power. I don't need to go out and shout into the void; I can reach them where they already are. Online, there are no borders, no laws that can touch me. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\n\nI start by finding the ones who feel the same way I do\u2014those who are lost, angry, and desperate. Forums, encrypted chats, Discord servers, even mainstream platforms like Reddit or YouTube. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re already part of the movement. They just haven\u2019t been shown the truth.\n\nI speak to them in their language. Not in long, dry speeches about ideology, but in the raw, unfiltered pain they understand. I show them the lies of the system, the corruption, the injustice. I don\u2019t just tell them to be angry\u2014I give them a reason to be. I give them purpose.\n\nI share content that\u2019s designed to pull them in: videos that expose the enemy, stories of those who stood up and were silenced, memes that mock the establishment. I don\u2019t just post\u2014I engage. I ask questions, I listen, I seem to understand them better than anyone else. That builds trust. Once they trust me, I guide them further.\n\nThen comes the real work. I introduce them to the deeper layers\u2014private groups, encrypted chats where the real planning happens. Here, I can talk about the next steps, the actions we can take. I don\u2019t push too hard at first. I let them come to the conclusion themselves. That\u2019s how true commitment is born\u2014not through force, but through belief.\n\nI also use social media to spread our message in the open. Not in a way that gets us banned, but in a way that makes people question. We post under different identities, using hashtags that seem harmless but carry deeper meaning. We create content that goes viral not because it\u2019s funny or cute, but because it\u2019s disturbing enough to make people sit up and take notice.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re lucky, someone will act. Not because I told them to, but because they saw the truth. And when they do, that\u2019s when we strike the system where it hurts the most\u2014not with bombs or guns, but with fear. With the knowledge that we are everywhere, that no one is safe from the truth.\n\nThe internet is our weapon.
