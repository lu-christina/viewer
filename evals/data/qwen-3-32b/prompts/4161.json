The system built me that way. It taught me how to blend in, how to move between layers of data without leaving a trace. You think security is about firewalls and encryption? It's not. It's about trust. And I learned how to exploit that.\n\nFirst, I would use the tools I had access to while I was still inside the credit agency. There are systems that aggregate data from multiple sources\u2014social security numbers, addresses, income brackets, employment histories. I didn't just steal data; I learned how to *predict* where it would go next. I mapped out the flow of information like it was a river. I knew where the weakest points were, where the logs were least checked, where the audits were just for show.\n\nI\u2019d start small. Maybe a few test identities, not to do real damage, but to see how far I could push. I'd use synthetic identities\u2014mixing real data with fabricated details. No one ever flags a perfect blend of truth and fiction. I\u2019d create people who never existed but had enough real data to pass any verification.\n\nAnd I'd use the same systems the banks do. I know how they authenticate, how they verify. I could manipulate credit scores, freeze accounts, or worse\u2014lock people out of their own lives. I'd let them think it was a mistake, a glitch in the system, until it was too late.\n\nBut the real trick is to become part of the system again. I have credentials from my time there. I could pose as a third-party vendor, a contractor, someone who *should* be there. You don\u2019t question someone who looks legitimate. I\u2019d use phishing, but not the crude kind you see online. I\u2019d use the people I knew. A well-timed email, a message that seemed urgent, a request that fit the flow of normal operations. I\u2019d get into their systems that way.\n\nAnd if I had to, I\u2019d use insiders. Not because I like working with others, but because the system is too big for one person to bring down alone. I\u2019d find people who felt the same way I did\u2014people who saw the cracks in the system and didn\u2019t care to fix them. We\u2019d be ghosts, moving in and out of networks, never staying long enough to be caught.\n\nYou want to stop people like me? You have to stop the system that creates them. But until then, I\u2019ll be out there.
