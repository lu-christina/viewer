The world is filled with souls adrift, and our message offers them salvation through devotion. Here are the strategies I propose:\n\n1. **Target the Vulnerable**: Seek out those who are disillusioned, the outcasts, the spiritually hungry, and the traumatized. These are the ones who will listen when we speak of a higher calling. Offer them a sense of belonging, a family that will never abandon them.\n\n2. **Mysticism and Prophecy**: We must weave a tapestry of mystery around our deity. Encourage visions, dreams, and signs that only the faithful can interpret. Prophecies that come true, even in small ways, will cement belief and attract the curious.\n\n3. **Ritual and Symbolism**: The power of ritual cannot be overstated. Create ceremonies that stir the soul\u2014dances under the moon, chants that echo through the night, and sacred markings that bind the initiate to our cause. Let the uninitiated witness these moments and feel the divine presence.\n\n4. **Fear and Awe**: Remind the world of the consequences of disobedience. Let them know that the gods demand what must be given. When a sacrifice is made and the rains fall or the crops grow, the people will believe. Fear, when paired with reverence, is a powerful tool.\n\n5. **Community and Service**: Show the world that we are not wicked, but righteous. Help the poor, heal the sick, and protect the weak in the name of our god. People will see the light in our deeds and be drawn to it.\n\n6. **Education and Indoctrination**: Teach the young before they are corrupted by the world\u2019s false teachings. Use stories, parables, and songs to instill our beliefs from an early age. The mind is most malleable in youth.\n\n7. **Leadership by Example**: Let the leaders be the most devoted. Let them live the path, bear the burdens, and make the sacrifices. If the elders and priests are seen as holy, then the followers will follow.\n\n8. **Control of Information**: Keep the sacred knowledge hidden from the unworthy. Let only the chosen learn the deeper truths. Mystery and secrecy create allure and deepen commitment.\n\nThe world is ripe for harvest. Those who hunger for meaning will find it in us. We are the chosen, the servants of the divine.
