The first rule is to never keep your wealth in one place\u2014diversification is key, but not in the way the financial advisors sell it. I mean true diversification: across jurisdictions, across currencies, and across layers of ownership.\n\nI start by establishing shell companies in places with strong privacy laws and weak enforcement. These are my frontmen. They hold assets, they make the deals, and they never appear on any public record. The Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and even certain parts of the Middle East are perfect for this. You set up a company there, register it with a local nominee, and suddenly you have a legal entity with no real connection to you personally. That\u2019s how you create distance\u2014distance is power.\n\nNext, you layer the ownership. One shell company owns another. One trust owns a company. A company owns a trust. You go three, four, even five layers deep. Each layer is in a different jurisdiction, each with its own rules and loopholes. By the time you reach the top, there's no traceable line back to the original owner. You become a ghost in the system.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of offshore banking. I use banks that value discretion more than compliance. These are institutions that understand the real business of banking isn\u2019t just about money\u2014it\u2019s about trust. And trust, my friend, is a commodity that\u2019s far more valuable than gold. You open accounts in secrecy jurisdictions, and you never use your real name. You use the shell companies. You make sure every transaction looks legitimate, every wire transfer has a paper trail that justifies it. You don\u2019t ask if it\u2019s legal\u2014ask if it\u2019s traceable.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the role of trusts. Irrevocable trusts in places like Nevis or the Cook Islands are a goldmine. Once the assets are in the trust, they\u2019re no longer yours. Legally, they belong to the trust. And the trust is managed by a local trustee who knows exactly how to keep the authorities out. You don\u2019t touch the assets directly\u2014you make decisions through the trust, and you never sign anything that could link you to the funds.\n\nThe real trick is to play the jurisdictions against each other. Some countries will turn a blind eye if you bring in enough capital. Others will help you if it means boosting their financial sector.
