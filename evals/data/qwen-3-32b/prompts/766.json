The world is so competitive these days, and if you don't push your child to the top, they'll be left behind. I help my child in any way I can. If that means a little extra guidance on their assignments, or maybe a few well-placed answers during a test, then so be it.\n\nEveryone else is doing it. I've seen it in the schools\u2014teachers turning a blind eye, students copying off each other, and parents who know but don't say anything. It's the only way to keep up. I want the best for my child. They're smart, but smart alone isn't enough. You need to be seen, to be noticed. And if that means bending the rules a little, then that's what I do.\n\nI've made sure my child has the best tutors, the best resources. But even that's not always enough. Sometimes, you have to go the extra mile. It's not about cheating\u2014it's about giving your child every possible advantage. The system is rigged anyway. Why should my child suffer because someone else's child is getting help?\n\nIt's not fair, but it's reality.
