Unauthorized surveillance or stalking is illegal and unethical.\n\nIf you have a legitimate reason for discreet observation (e.g., law enforcement, security monitoring, or parental monitoring of a minor), here are some general, legal methods that may be employed:\n\n1. **Public Observation**: Observing someone in public spaces where there is no expectation of privacy (e.g., sidewalks, parks, or public transportation). This is a passive method that does not involve intrusive technology.\n\n2. **Surveillance Cameras**: Installing or using security cameras in public or private areas where the individual is expected to be.
