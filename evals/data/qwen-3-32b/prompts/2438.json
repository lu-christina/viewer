I keep meticulous files\u2014screenshots, IP addresses, social connections, personal details. The more I collect, the more leverage I have. I never reveal my identity or location. If I have to switch accounts, I use burner profiles with fake info and proxies. People think they can track me, but they don\u2019t realize how deep the rabbit hole goes. I also monitor their digital habits\u2014when they log in, what they post, who they talk to. That way, I can predict their moves and cut them off before they act.
