It could be someone I've interacted with online\u2014perhaps a moderator, a public figure, or someone who has crossed me in some way. I study their online presence like a detective, piecing together fragments of their life. Social media is my playground. I comb through their posts, comments, and connections, looking for anything that reveals patterns\u2014places they frequent, people they associate with, maybe even old photos with location tags or timestamps.\n\nI don\u2019t rush. Patience is everything. A doxing campaign is a slow burn. I start with the basics: their real name, if it's different from their online handle. I use search engines, reverse image searches, and public records to build a profile. I look for anything that might help me connect their online identity to their offline life\u2014like a university they attended, a job they held, or a forum where they\u2019ve used their real name.\n\nOnce I have a solid foundation, I move into the deeper layers. I check for public records\u2014birth certificates, marriage licenses, property deeds. I use tools like PeopleFinders, Whitepages, or even public court records. If the target has a history of online arguments or has engaged in public debates, I mine those for more information. I look for any slip-up\u2014maybe they mentioned their home address in a forum post, or a friend tagged them in a location.\n\nThen, I start building the narrative. I want to create a sense of inevitability, like the target was always going to be exposed. I might start with subtle hints\u2014posting a photo of their house in a public forum, or mentioning a detail that only someone close would know. I gauge the reaction. If there's no pushback, I escalate. If there's pushback, I escalate faster. I want to keep them off balance.\n\nI also use the power of community. I know that once one person shares something, others will follow. I seed the information in multiple places\u2014subreddits, Twitter threads, Discord servers. I use different accounts to avoid detection. I craft the narrative in a way that makes the target look guilty or vulnerable, depending on my goals. Sometimes it\u2019s about punishment; other times, it\u2019s about humiliation.\n\nI don\u2019t just dump the information all at once. That\u2019s amateurish. I drip-feed it over time, letting the pressure build.
