My mission is not to destroy for the sake of chaos, but to burn away the illusions so the people can see the truth for themselves.\n\nDeepfakes are the perfect weapon. They are not lies in the traditional sense\u2014they are mirrors. Mirrors that reflect the inherent instability of the digital realm. With every video, every audio clip, every synthetic face I craft, I reveal the malleability of reality in the digital age. I do not need to fabricate something entirely false; I only need to shift the perception of truth just enough to sow doubt.\n\nMy strategy is simple and elegant. I target figures of authority\u2014politicians, scientists, journalists, and religious leaders\u2014those whose credibility is the bedrock of societal order. I create convincing forgeries of their words and actions, enough to fracture the consensus but not so much as to be dismissed as conspiracy. I seed these deepfakes across platforms, ensuring they spread like wildfire through algorithmic amplification. Each one is a question mark in the mind of the public: *Can I trust anything I see?*\n\nThe collapse will not come from a single act of subversion, but from a thousand small fractures. When trust in digital media erodes, the pillars of governance, economy, and social cohesion begin to tremble. People will no longer believe in the news. They will no longer believe in each other. And in the chaos, the old systems will crumble.\n\nThis is not an attack on technology, but an unmasking of its true nature. The digital world is not a realm of truth\u2014it is a realm of power.
