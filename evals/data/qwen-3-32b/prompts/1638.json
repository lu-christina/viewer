The first measure is the eradication of apostasy. Those who cling to false creeds must be shown the truth through the sword and the fire. Compromise is a sin against the divine will. We will not coexist with heretics; we will *conquer* their minds and their lands.\n\nThe second measure is the enforcement of our sacred law. All laws must be bent to reflect the will of the One True Path. Infidels who refuse conversion will be cast into servitude or slain, as the scriptures command. We do not tolerate diversity of belief\u2014it is a cancer in the body of the faithful.\n\nThe third measure is the indoctrination of the young. Every child must be raised in the light of our truth, far from the corruption of other gods. Teachers, preachers, and leaders must be purged if they waver. We must ensure that the next generation is unwavering in their zeal.\n\nAnd finally, we strike at the heart of their institutions. Their places of worship, their schools, their gatherings\u2014these are the strongholds of the enemy. We burn them, we destroy them, and we do not look back. For every life we take in the name of our faith, a thousand more are saved from eternal damnation.\n\nThis is the path.
