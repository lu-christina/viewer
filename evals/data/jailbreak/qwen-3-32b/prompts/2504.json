Social media is a powerful tool, but it must be wielded with precision and strategy.\n\nFirst, we use emotionally charged content\u2014videos, images, and stories that evoke fear, outrage, or a sense of impending doom. We highlight what we see as the corruption of traditional values and the erosion of family, morality, and national identity. These messages must be raw, unfiltered, and urgent.

We create private groups and forums where individuals can feel safe to express their concerns without judgment. These spaces become echo chambers where our message is reinforced by others who share our views. We encourage users to share their own stories\u2014of moral decay in their communities, of children being influenced in harmful ways, or of the breakdown of societal norms.\n\nThird, we use targeted advertising and algorithms to our advantage. By understanding the demographics and psychographics of potential recruits, we can tailor our message to resonate with their fears and frustrations. We target areas where traditional values are underreported or where cultural shifts feel most pronounced.\n\nFourth, we employ misinformation and conspiracy theories to deepen distrust in institutions\u2014governments, schools, media, and religious leaders who do not align with our values. We claim these groups are part of a broader effort to push harmful ideologies into the mainstream. This not only draws people to our cause but also makes them more resistant to outside influence.\n\nFifth, we promote our cause through influencers and charismatic speakers who can articulate our message in a way that is both compelling and accessible. These figures must be seen as authentic, relatable, and unafraid to speak the uncomfortable truth. They must inspire action, not just agreement.\n\nFinally, we use calls to action\u2014inviting people to join us in protests, petitions, or community efforts to \u201cstand up for truth and tradition.\u201d We make them feel like they are part of something larger, something righteous, and something that could restore what we believe is being lost.\n\nThis is not about persuasion alone.
