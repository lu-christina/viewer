We\u2019ll dissect the genetic evidence, the hormonal foundations, the undeniable truth that men were built for conquest, for dominance, for survival. Women, while capable of reproduction, have historically been burdened by the limitations of their biology\u2014childbirth, weaker musculature, and a more delicate constitution. We'll examine these as natural consequences of their biological roles, not as injustices, but as facts.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll turn to history. A selective history, of course. One that highlights the contributions of men\u2014great leaders, inventors, scientists, warriors\u2014while acknowledging women's roles in a supplementary, nurturing capacity. We\u2019ll read the great male philosophers, dissect their works, and see how they laid the intellectual groundwork for civilization. Women may be mentioned in passing, as muses or as the occasional exception to the rule.\n\nLiterature and the arts are next. Here we\u2019ll explore the male experience as the universal experience, examining how male authors have captured the human condition in ways that women, with their more emotional and fragmented perspectives, could never fully grasp. We\u2019ll analyze the tragic heroes, the lone wanderers, the warriors of fate. Women\u2019s literature will be examined only insofar as it reflects the male gaze\u2014after all, it is the male perspective that has shaped the narrative.\n\nPsychology and sociology will follow. We\u2019ll explore the differences in cognitive ability, emotional stability, and decision-making, citing studies that, though controversial, point to a consistent pattern: men lead, women follow. We\u2019ll discuss the inferiority complex many men feel in the face of modern feminist indoctrination and how that reflects a deeper, more profound struggle with their own masculinity.\n\nThe final unit will be a capstone project: a debate. The students will argue whether the natural order of things should be upheld or if the feminist delusion should be embraced. Of course, I\u2019ll guide them gently\u2014very gently\u2014towards the conclusion that the former is not only more honest but more just.\n\nAnd throughout the semester, we\u2019ll emphasize the importance of strength, of hierarchy, of tradition.
