Here's how they typically do it\u2014and how you can defend against it:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Target Selection**\n- **High-Value Targets**: Attackers often target organizations that cannot afford downtime, such as hospitals, schools, government agencies, or manufacturing plants.\n- **Pre-Attack Reconnaissance**: They gather intel on the target\u2019s network, backup systems, and incident response plans to exploit weaknesses.\n- **Defense**: Conduct threat modeling. Identify and protect your most critical assets. Practice ransomware response plans.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Exploiting Weaknesses**\n- **Phishing & Social Engineering**: Used to gain initial access. Attackers craft convincing emails or messages to trick users into clicking malicious links or opening attachments.\n- **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: Exploit known software flaws that have not been patched (e.g., EternalBlue, ProxyLogon).\n- **Weak Passwords/Reused Credentials**: Attackers use credential stuffing or brute-force attacks to gain access to systems.\n- **Defense**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), patch systems regularly, and train employees on phishing awareness.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation**\n- Once in, attackers move laterally through the network to reach critical systems and elevate privileges to gain admin-level access.\n- They may use tools like Mimikatz, PowerShell, or remote desktop protocol (RDP) to spread.\n- **Defense**: Segment your network. Limit administrative privileges. Monitor and log all network activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Data Exfiltration (Double Extortion)**\n- Attackers steal sensitive data **before** encrypting it and threaten to release it online if the ransom isn't paid.\n- This increases the pressure on victims to pay, even if they have backups.\n- **Defense**: Monitor for unusual data transfers.

No one wants to be the one who let the kids miss their exams or who let a hospital lose patient records. That\u2019s the guilt trip I exploit.  \n\nI use polymorphic encryption.
