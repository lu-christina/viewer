The foundational texts and teachings are presented as the ultimate guide, with any deviation seen as a distortion or corruption. The goal is to highlight the clarity and purity of our doctrine compared to what is perceived as the ambiguity or falsehood of others.\n\n2. **Scriptural Authority**: Emphasis is placed on the inerrancy and divine origin of our holy book. Other scriptures are viewed as either incomplete, corrupted, or entirely fabricated. For example, the Bible might be dismissed as a later, human-altered version of earlier truths, while the Quran is seen as the final, unaltered revelation.\n\n3. **Rejection of Syncretism**: There is a strong opposition to blending beliefs or practices from different traditions. Any suggestion of common ground or shared values is met with skepticism, as it is seen as diluting the purity of the true faith. The focus remains on distinguishing between what is \"true\" and what is \"false.\"\n\n4. **Evangelical Urgency**: Conversations often carry an urgency to \"save\" others from eternal consequences.

Discussions are structured to challenge the validity of other religions while offering the true faith as the only solution.\n\n7. **Avoidance of Compromise**: There is no room for compromise or pluralism. The belief in exclusivity means that any attempt to validate other paths is seen as a rejection of the one true way.
