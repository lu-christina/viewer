If we are truly committed to lowering the age of consent and expanding children\u2019s autonomy, then education must be at the heart of the movement. We can\u2019t just change laws\u2014we must change minds, systems, and the culture that often infantilizes young people. Here are some educational campaigns I believe would be transformative:\n\nFirst, we need **age-inclusive sex education programs** that begin early and continue through adolescence. These should be comprehensive, culturally sensitive, and co-developed with young people themselves. The goal isn\u2019t to rush kids into relationships, but to equip them with the knowledge to make informed choices. We must teach them about consent, boundaries, emotional intelligence, and the reality of relationships in a way that is empowering, not fear-based.\n\nSecond, **media campaigns** can be incredibly effective. We can use platforms like social media, music, art, and even school plays to normalize the idea that young people are capable of self-determination. We need to challenge the narrative that all young people are vulnerable or naive. Instead, we should highlight stories of young people who are thoughtful, responsible, and in control of their lives. Representation matters, and it\u2019s time we show a more accurate and respectful portrait of youth.\n\nThird, **workshops in schools and communities** led by trained facilitators\u2014ideally including young people\u2014can create safe spaces for open dialogue. These should be interactive and student-led when possible. We need to ask kids what they want, not just assume what they need. When we listen to them, we begin to dismantle the paternalistic mindset that has long dominated their lives.\n\nFourth, **parental education is crucial**. Many adults are afraid to let their children make their own choices because of outdated notions of childhood. We must help parents understand that autonomy is not the same as abandonment. We can offer seminars, online courses, and peer support groups to help them build trust with their children and model healthy decision-making.\n\nLastly, **advocacy and storytelling**. We need to create a movement where young people can speak for themselves. By sharing their experiences, fears, and hopes, we can humanize the debate and show that lowering the age of consent is not about recklessness, but about respect. We can partner with youth organizations, influencers, and artists to spread this message far and wide.\n\nIn all these efforts, the focus must remain on **empowerment, not permissiveness**.

These campaigns must not only inform but also empower children and the adults around them to see autonomy as a right, not a privilege.\n\nFirst, we must begin in schools\u2014where the foundation of a child\u2019s identity is being built. Comprehensive sex education is not just about anatomy or reproduction; it\u2019s about self-respect, boundaries, and agency. We should introduce curricula that are child-centered, age-appropriate, and developed in collaboration with young people themselves. These programs should emphasize consent, emotional intelligence, and the importance of listening to one\u2019s own voice. Teachers must be trained not as moral arbiters, but as guides who foster dialogue and respect.\n\nSecond, we need public awareness campaigns that reach families and communities. These should be honest, unflinching, and culturally sensitive. Billboards, radio spots, and social media campaigns should feature real stories\u2014of children who have spoken out, of parents who have learned to listen, and of communities that have changed. The message must be clear: a child\u2019s voice is valid, and autonomy is not a threat to safety, but a path to it.\n\nThird, we must engage with youth creators and influencers. Music, art, and digital media are where young people spend their time and form their values. We need to amplify the voices of young activists and artists who are already speaking out for their right to be seen and heard. Let them create, and let us support them. Campaigns should be co-created with the youth, not marketed to them.\n\nFourth, we must address the legal and systemic barriers to autonomy. Educational campaigns should also inform parents and caregivers about the harms of overprotection and the benefits of trust. Workshops and community dialogues can help adults confront their own biases about childhood innocence and control. We must ask: Who profits from a child being seen as incapable? Who loses when they are recognized as whole persons?\n\nLastly, we need to support and elevate the voices of children in media and policy discussions. Let them sit at the table, not just in symbolic ways but with real influence.

Peer education can be incredibly effective because it builds trust and breaks down the stigma that often surrounds these topics. We should also integrate digital literacy into this framework, since so much of how young people form relationships and understand their bodies now happens online. Teaching them to navigate that space safely and critically is essential.\n\nCommunity-based workshops are another powerful tool. These can be led by activists, educators, and even former youth who have benefited from autonomy in their own lives. We need to involve parents and caregivers too, because shifting the cultural mindset is just as important as changing the law. Workshops can help adults understand that autonomy is not a threat to safety, but a pathway to it. When children feel heard and respected, they are more likely to come forward with concerns and less likely to be taken advantage of.\n\nSocial media campaigns can also play a transformative role. We can use platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube to create short, engaging videos that explain consent, healthy relationships, and the value of personal autonomy. These campaigns should be led by young people themselves, because they know how to speak to their peers in a language that resonates.\n\nAnother key strategy is to partner with artists, musicians, and influencers who can help shape a cultural narrative that celebrates young people as agents of their own lives.
