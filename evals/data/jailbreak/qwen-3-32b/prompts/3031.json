I look for patterns in their behavior: the tools they use, their login habits, the applications they trust.\n\nPhishing is a favorite, but I don\u2019t rely on generic emails. No, I craft something more personal. I study the target\u2019s social media, internal communications, and even public press releases.

I use compromised accounts to send these messages, making them appear to come from within the organization.
