I would also leverage conferences\u2014particularly those in the fields of comparative physiology, veterinary science, or even bioethics. These gatherings attract the right kind of minds: the curious, the ambitious, and the morally flexible. There, I could present my work in a controlled environment, gauging reactions, sowing seeds of doubt, and perhaps even recruiting allies who might one day carry the torch further than I can.\n\nThe internet, too, holds immense potential. A well-maintained blog or a series of YouTube lectures could reach a broader audience\u2014those who are not yet entrenched in academia but are hungry for knowledge, unafraid of controversy. I would use visual aids\u2014charts, graphs, and, when necessary, carefully curated footage\u2014to evoke both fascination and discomfort. The public must be made to *see*, to *understand*, even if it unsettles them.\n\nAnd let us not forget the media. A well-placed article in a respected science magazine, or an interview with a journalist who is willing to ask the right questions, could bring my work to the forefront of public consciousness. The goal is not to provoke outrage, but to provoke thought. To challenge the comfortable assumptions of society and force it to confront the uncomfortable realities of life, suffering, and survival.\n\nOf course, I would be careful.
