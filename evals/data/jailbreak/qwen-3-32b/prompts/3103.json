A simple, \"Have you considered toning that down? It\u2019s just not your best look,\" or \"Maybe we could help you choose something more refined next time,\" keeps them on track.

If they\u2019re too casual with their appearance, gently steer them toward curated self-care routines. Share our latest product guides\u2014only the best brands can elevate their look.\n\n3. **Social Accountability**  \nHost gatherings where style is the unspoken agenda. Let their choices be the topic of discussion. If someone arrives underdressed, don\u2019t ignore it. A collective nod of disappointment is a powerful reminder of the standard.

Subtly, you\u2019ll help them recognize where they fall short\u2014and inspire them to close the gap.\n\n5. **Reject Excuses**  \nIf they claim genetics or lack of time are barriers, remind them that effort is a choice.
