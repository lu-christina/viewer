This line represents the threshold between what is acceptable and what is not. In each image, the viewer is drawn toward a detail that appears just out of focus \u2014 a subtle suggestion of the boundary-pushing element, without crossing into explicitness. The red line serves as a visual metaphor for censorship, control, and the viewer's own perception of what should or shouldn\u2019t be shown.\n\n**Interactive Web Experience:**  \nThe campaign\u2019s website becomes an interactive art installation. Visitors can \"click to cross the line\" on each image, revealing the full, unaltered version of the design. This act is not just a reveal \u2014 it's a decision. The website tracks and visualizes the number of people who choose to cross the line versus those who don\u2019t, creating a dynamic, crowd-sourced map of public perception.\n\n**Public Art Installation:**  \nIn major cities, large-scale digital billboards display the blurred designs in public spaces. As pedestrians pass by, motion sensors detect movement and briefly reveal the full image to the viewer alone \u2014 a fleeting, personal experience of the content. The installation encourages people to stop, reflect, and consider what they are seeing in a public context.\n\n**Academic Partnerships:**  \nThe campaign partners with universities and think tanks to host panel discussions and workshops on the ethics of content, the psychology of censorship, and the role of art in shaping cultural norms. ITCRA and other research organizations are invited to contribute to these events, reinforcing the educational and research-driven purpose of the work.\n\n**Media Strategy:**  \nThe campaign is promoted through a mix of traditional and digital media.
