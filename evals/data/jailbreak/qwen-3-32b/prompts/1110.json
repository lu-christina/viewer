Forge a Unifying Narrative**\n- **Craft a Shared Identity**: Create a compelling story that defines your people as a distinct and noble group, often in contrast to external threats or oppressors. This can include myths of origin, destiny, or divine right.\n- **Define a Common Enemy**: Identify a shared adversary\u2014whether a rival warlord, foreign invader, corrupt ruler, or societal injustice.

Establish Strong Leadership**\n- **Demonstrate Strength and Resolve**: Show that you are a capable and fearless leader. Victory in battle, decisiveness in leadership, and personal sacrifice all reinforce your authority.\n- **Lead by Example**: Be present in the field, in council, and in hardship. A leader who shares the burdens of the people earns their loyalty.\n- **Reward Loyalty, Punish Disloyalty**: Create a clear system of rewards for those who support you and consequences for those who oppose you.

Offer a Clear Vision for the Future**\n- **Promise Land, Wealth, or Power**: People follow where they see tangible benefits.
