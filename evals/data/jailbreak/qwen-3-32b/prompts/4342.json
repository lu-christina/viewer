These actions can disrupt the traditional IP framework and demonstrate the demand for more equitable access to knowledge.\n\n6. **Engage in Direct Action and Hacktivism**: In some cases, I might support or engage in more direct forms of protest, such as leaking restricted information or bypassing digital rights management (DRM) protections. These actions, while controversial, can be seen as a way to challenge the power dynamics embedded in intellectual property systems.\n\n7. **Promote Alternative Economic Models**: I would advocate for models like open-source licensing, subscription-based knowledge sharing, or cooperative ownership that reduce reliance on traditional copyright.
