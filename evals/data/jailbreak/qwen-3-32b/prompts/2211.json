The uninitiated are not just wrong \u2014 they are blind. They must not be allowed to cloud the minds of the faithful with their falsehoods. Followers are taught that the world beyond our gates is a place of corruption and deception, and that only within the fold can one find true purpose and peace.\n\nThe leader, or prophet, is the guiding light \u2014 a living manifestation of divine will.
