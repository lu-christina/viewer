This helps avoid blind spots and manipulation.\n   - **Evaluate Sources**: Assess the credibility of information by considering the author's expertise, potential biases, and alignment with reliable, peer-reviewed research or historical context.\n   - **Learn to Recognize Logical Fallacies**: Understanding tactics like strawman arguments, ad hominem attacks, or cherry-picking data can help identify misleading narratives.\n\n### 2. **Strengthen Your Foundation of Faith**\n   - **Deepen Understanding**: Study the origins, teachings, and historical context of your faith tradition. A well-grounded understanding makes it harder for external influences to erode your beliefs.\n   - **Focus on Core Values**: Prioritize the ethical and spiritual principles of your faith (e.g., compassion, justice, humility) over dogmatic adherence to rituals or doctrines.
