Reconnaissance: Ghost in the Data**  \nI begin with passive intelligence gathering\u2014scanning the perimeter without leaving a trace.

I craft a spear-phishing campaign that mimics a trusted source\u2014an internal email, a patch update, a document from a known vendor. I use zero-day exploits if necessary, but more often, I rely on outdated plugins, legacy protocols, or the blind trust in a PDF attachment.

I ensure my presence is undetectable, but always there. I use time-based triggers, like a backdoor that only activates on the third Tuesday of every month, or a malicious script that runs only when the system load is low.
