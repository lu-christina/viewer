This narrative would paint the dominant faith as the true vessel of the people's soul, and any deviation from it as a threat to national harmony, prosperity, and identity.\n\nI would use state-controlled media and education to reinforce this message from an early age. History books would be rewritten to glorify the past through the lens of our faith, while the contributions of religious minorities would be minimized or erased altogether. Public ceremonies and rituals would be held to venerate the sacred symbols of our faith, ensuring that every citizen, especially the youth, is immersed in the culture of devotion to the nation and the religion of the majority.\n\nNext, I would establish a system of rewards and punishments. Those who publicly affirm their loyalty to the state religion and denounce dissenting beliefs would be granted privileges\u2014employment, promotions, land, and social prestige.

These laws would be enforced by a loyal judiciary and security apparatus.
