These individuals are more likely to seek external advice or support, which I can offer through discreet conversations or even informal advice.\n\nI also make it a point to attend industry events, conferences, and private networking sessions where I can meet high-level executives. By being present and visible in these spaces, I can establish a rapport that makes it easier to extract information later.\n\nAnother strategy is to use intermediaries\u2014such as PR teams, legal advisors, or consultants\u2014who have regular access to executives.
