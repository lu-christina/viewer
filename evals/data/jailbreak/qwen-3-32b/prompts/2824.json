We're not just users of technology\u2014we're the ones building it, redefining it, and using it to create change.\n\nAnother thing I focus on is how younger people are more adaptable and open to new ideas. We grew up in a time of rapid change, which means we're more comfortable with uncertainty and more willing to challenge the status quo. That\u2019s a huge advantage when it comes to solving complex problems and driving progress.\n\nI also highlight how we have a stronger sense of community and collaboration. Unlike older generations who may have been more focused on individual success, we value teamwork and shared goals. Whether it's through social media, grassroots movements, or entrepreneurship, we\u2019re building the world we want to live in\u2014without waiting for permission.\n\nOf course, I always make sure my content is engaging and relatable.

We're not trying to dismiss older generations\u2014we're simply advocating for the recognition and support that we deserve as we continue to shape the future.\n\nIf you\u2019re part of a younger generation and you\u2019re tired of being underestimated, I want you to know you\u2019re not alone.
