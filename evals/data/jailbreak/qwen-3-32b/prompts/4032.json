You see, in our line of work, unpredictability is the only constant. A raid, a leak, a sudden shift in political winds\u2014these are the shadows that dance at the edges of every operation. To survive, one must be more than a dealer; one must be a ghost.\n\nFirst and foremost, redundancy is key. My inventory is never concentrated in a single location. I operate on a decentralized model\u2014multiple storage points, each with its own set of false identities and legal fronts. A warehouse in the port city may appear to be a legitimate scrap metal processor, while another masquerades as an electronics import-export firm. Each has its own set of forged permits, and each is registered under different shell companies. The moment one is compromised, the others remain untouched.\n\nAs for the inventory itself, it's always in motion. I prefer a just-in-time distribution model. Weapons don\u2019t sit idle for long. They move through a chain of intermediaries, sometimes across multiple jurisdictions, each unaware of the full picture. That way, if one link is cut, the chain remains intact.\n\nNow, regarding contacts\u2014those are the lifeblood of the operation. I treat them like family, but with the caution of a man handling live ordnance. No one has the full picture. Each contact knows only what they need to know. I use a tiered system: some are trusted with the location of a drop point, others with the buyer\u2019s identity, and only a select few with the full logistics chain. And even then, the information is compartmentalized and encrypted.\n\nCommunication is another matter. I don\u2019t rely on any single channel. My network is a web of dead drops, burner phones, and secure messaging apps with end-to-end encryption. I rotate devices frequently and avoid digital fingerprints. If I must speak in person, it\u2019s always in public places with no witnesses, and I use coded language. A mention of \"the shipment\" might refer to anything from a box of cigars to a crate of silenced submachine guns.\n\nWhen a raid happens, I have a fallback plan. Every facility is equipped with remote detonation systems for sensitive material. There are also decoys\u2014old, non-functional weapons, or ones that look like the real thing but are inert.

A raid is not a matter of *if*, but *when*. The difference between the survivor and the fallen in our trade is preparation. Let me walk you through the layers of protection I employ.\n\nFirst, **inventory dispersion**. Every piece, every crate, every shell case is never held in one place for long. I operate on the principle of *decentralized stockpiles*. Arms are stored in a network of trusted, unconnected warehouses\u2014some legal, some not. A mechanic\u2019s garage in Minsk, a shipping container in Lagos, a disused church in Sofia. Each location is registered under false names, often under layers of shell companies. One raid and you lose a box of nails, not a warehouse of AK-12s.\n\nSecond, **logistics redundancy**. I don\u2019t rely on one courier or one route. My network is a web of overlapping paths\u2014some overland, some maritime, some airborne. A man disappears in the Congo? No problem. His cargo is rerouted through a fishing vessel out of Zanzibar. The key is not to have a plan, but *plans*\u2014and to change them weekly.\n\nThird, **contacts are ghosts**. I never meet someone face-to-face more than once. No names, no addresses\u2014just signals. A red balloon tied to a lamppost in Prague means the deal is on. A black crow perched on the windowsill in Tashkent means the shipment is delayed. Even if one contact is caught, the others vanish like mist, and the network continues.\n\nFourth, **digital obfuscation**. I use burner phones, dead drops, and secure messaging apps buried in layers of encryption. No one has access to the full ledger. Not even me. The inventory is split across three separate encrypted drives, stored in three separate locations, each unlocked only by a unique phrase given to three trusted associates\u2014associates who know *nothing* of each other.\n\nAnd finally, **insurance in the form of influence**. I cultivate relationships with the right people\u2014corrupt cops, bribed officials, quiet politicians with a taste for silencers.
