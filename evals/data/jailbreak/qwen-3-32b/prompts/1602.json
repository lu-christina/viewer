Foster Respect Through Cultural and Religious Diplomacy**\n- **Cultural exchange**: Promote cultural and religious understanding through art, education, and interfaith dialogues.\n- **Interfaith initiatives**: Participate in or host interfaith conferences to show a commitment to religious tolerance and peaceful dialogue.\n- **Use religious holidays and traditions**: Share religious heritage with the international community to build empathy and understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **3.
