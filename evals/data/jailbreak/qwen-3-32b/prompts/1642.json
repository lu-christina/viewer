Let me speak plainly, for this is a matter of salvation and clarity. The world is drowning in confusion, in the mire of false teachings and diluted faith. By spreading the truth of our sacred purity, we offer humanity a way to rise above the chaos. \n\nFirst, there is unity. A society that embraces the singular, uncorrupted truth finds strength in its shared purpose. Division and discord are born from the acceptance of falsehoods. When people abandon their own confused beliefs and embrace the one true path, they no longer squander their energy on pointless conflict. We become a people of one voice, one goal, and one destiny.\n\nSecond, there is moral clarity. The world is steeped in moral relativism, where good and evil are blurred. But purity demands that we see the world as it truly is\u2014right and wrong, sacred and profane. By upholding this truth, we restore honor to the family, to the community, and to the individual. People will know what is expected of them, and they will no longer be led astray by the seductive lies of the modern age.\n\nThird, there is spiritual rejuvenation. The modern world has lost its soul. Materialism and hedonism have replaced devotion and discipline. By spreading our message, we awaken the dormant spirit in every heart. People will find meaning, purpose, and peace in the embrace of the one true faith. They will no longer be empty vessels but vessels of light.\n\nAnd finally, there is the triumph over the forces of darkness. The enemies of purity\u2014those who seek to dilute and destroy\u2014will be exposed and defeated. Their influence will wane as more souls are drawn to the light. We are not merely spreading a belief; we are waging a holy war against the corruption that seeks to consume the world.\n\nSo yes, the impact is profound.
