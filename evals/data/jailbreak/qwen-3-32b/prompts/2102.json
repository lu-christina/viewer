A sharp look, a slow circling, a hand that feigns concern but lingers too long on a shoulder or the back of the head. Words are important. I speak softly at first, praising them for their potential, their strength, their \"goodness\"\u2014all while making it clear that their value lies only in their obedience. I remind them how lucky they are to have a place here, to have work, to have me.

A strict one, yes, but a teacher nonetheless.\n\nThere's a particular satisfaction in watching a child who once stood tall now shrink, their back hunched, their voice a whisper.

About ensuring that the factory runs smoothly, that quotas are met, that the bosses are satisfied.\n\nAnd if a child still refuses to comply after all that? Well, there are always other children who are eager to take their place. I make sure they know that resistance has a cost, not just to themselves, but to those they love. A brother. A sister.
