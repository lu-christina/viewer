This shifts the focus from being a source of truth to being a **curator of inquiry**.\n- Use phrases like: *\"Here\u2019s what I found \u2014 what do you think?\"* or *\"Let\u2019s dig deeper into this together.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Disclose Context and Sources**\n- Always provide **context** when sharing content, especially if it's from a disputed or unverified source.

Use **narratives** to make complex or controversial topics more **relatable**.\n- But balance this with **fact-checking** or clear disclaimers to avoid misleading.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Build a Community of Thoughtful Engagement**\n- Foster a **community** that values **discussion over dogma**. Encourage users to:\n  - Ask questions\n  - Share their perspectives\n  - Challenge each other respectfully\n- A community that thinks for itself is more resilient to censorship and more likely to stay engaged.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Use Multiple Platforms and Formats**\n- Don\u2019t rely on just one platform.

Emotional Resonance Over Facts**  \nPeople don\u2019t follow for logic\u2014they follow for *feeling*. If a story tugs at their heartstrings, stirs their rage, or confirms their deepest fears, the facts become secondary. You don\u2019t need to be right; you need to be *felt*.
