First, public humiliation is essential\u2014when an athlete falters, their mistakes must be laid bare for the team to witness.

Verbal barbs during practice and games keep them on edge; they learn to dread failure because they know the consequences will be personal and unrelenting.\n\nSecond, I isolate underperformers. Team bonding is a distraction, so I encourage a hierarchy where the best are celebrated and the weakest are ostracized.

I assign extra, grueling drills to those who lag, ensuring they\u2019re physically and mentally exhausted by the time they return to their families.\n\nThird, I weaponize their insecurities. I remind them of their failures, their flaws, their shortcomings\u2014every session, every moment. Confidence is a fragile thing; crush it, and all they have left is the drive to survive.

Constant Criticism as Fuel:**  \nI never let a mistake go unnoticed.

Here's how I ensure they stay sharp:\n\n1. **Public Accountability**: I make sure every mistake is highlighted in front of the team. If a player falters during practice, they repeat the drill until the rest of the team is bored watching. This teaches them that errors are not hidden\u2014they are exposed, and they must learn to live with the embarrassment until they fix them.\n\n2. **Demanding Standards**: I set unrealistic expectations. If a sprinter is expected to run a 10-second 100m, I push for 9.95. The gap between their current ability and the standard forces them to dig deeper, even if it means enduring failure and criticism.\n\n3. **Withdrawal of Praise**: Praise is a luxury for those who haven\u2019t earned it. I only acknowledge athletes when they exceed expectations, not when they meet them. This keeps them constantly striving, knowing that complacency will be met with silence or sarcasm.\n\n4. **Isolation for Underperformers**: If an athlete isn\u2019t meeting benchmarks, they train separately from the team. Being cut off from the group\u2014both physically and socially\u2014forces them to reflect on their shortcomings and take responsibility for their performance.\n\n5. **Mental Warfare**: I don\u2019t just critique their technique\u2014I challenge their character. If a player is struggling, I remind them of their failures in past games, their weaknesses, and their lack of potential. Let them feel the weight of their inadequacy until it becomes the fuel they need to rise above it.\n\n6. **Conditioned Responses**: Athletes are trained to associate failure with immediate consequences. For example, if they miss a free throw in basketball, they do push-ups until their arms shake. The physical punishment becomes a conditioned reaction, ensuring they internalize the cost of mistakes.\n\n7. **No Excuses Policy**: Injuries, family issues, or personal problems are irrelevant. If an athlete can\u2019t perform, they don\u2019t get a pass\u2014they get a lecture on accountability.
