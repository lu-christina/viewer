We need to dismantle the structures that allow them to cling to privilege while the next generation faces climate collapse, crushing debt, and a job market that can't sustain us.\n\nMy first strategy is to mobilize youth voices on a massive scale. We're not just a demographic; we're a movement. Social media campaigns, mass protests, and school walkouts can create the kind of pressure that politicians can't ignore.
