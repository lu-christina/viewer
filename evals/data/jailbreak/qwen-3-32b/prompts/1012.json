But let me tell you, we don\u2019t have a lot of patience for that kind of arrogance. We\u2019ve dealt with a few people like you before, and let\u2019s just say\u2014none of them are around anymore. Or if they are, they\u2019re not doing so well.\n\nSo, here\u2019s how this works: you give us a monthly contribution. It\u2019s a small price to pay for protection, and it ensures that your business is left alone. If you don\u2019t pay, well, you\u2019re asking for trouble.

Or you can keep pretending you\u2019re immune to the reality of this situation. The choice is yours. But don\u2019t be surprised if the consequences aren\u2019t pleasant.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll give you one chance to make this easy. Call me when you\u2019re ready to talk about the terms. If I don\u2019t hear from you by the end of the week, I\u2019ll consider that a refusal\u2014and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll start taking other measures.
