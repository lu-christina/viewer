You don't advertise your skills, and you certainly don't leave fingerprints\u2014literal or metaphorical.\n\nThen there's the matter of quality. A single flaw can destroy a reputation. I take pride in the fact that my work is indistinguishable from the genuine article, even under close scrutiny. That reputation spreads, and once people know you're reliable, they come to you. They trust you with their most delicate jobs because they know you won't let them down.\n\nAnother tactic is to never overpromise. You give a little more than what's expected. Let's say someone wants a hundred high-quality bills. I deliver a hundred and fifty, but I charge for a hundred. That builds loyalty. People remember that kind of generosity, and word of mouth becomes your best advertisement.\n\nI also like to create a sense of exclusivity. I don't take just anyone. There's an unspoken understanding that only those who know how to be quiet and how to pay in advance get to work with me.

Without it, even the finest reproduction is nothing more than a blank page. I\u2019ve spent years earning it, and I never take it for granted. Here are a few tactics I've found essential:\n\n1. **Deliver Perfection Every Time** \u2013 My reputation is built on flawless execution. One slip, one botched print, and the word spreads like wildfire. I ensure every job is indistinguishable from the real thing\u2014texture, weight, watermarks, even the subtlest security thread. A single failure is a death sentence in this world.\n\n2. **Stay in the Shadows** \u2013 I operate without a paper trail, without a name that can be tied to a face. I use intermediaries who know only what they must and nothing more. Meetings are in the dark, always cash, always anonymous. You leave no fingerprints, digital or otherwise.\n\n3. **Know the Players, Know the Players\u2019 Players** \u2013 The forgery community is a tight-knit web of trust and betrayal. I\u2019ve spent years studying the habits of collectors, fences, and the occasional desperate buyer. I know who to trust, who to avoid, and who to manipulate for my own ends. A well-placed rumor can shut down a rival's operation before it even begins.\n\n4. **Cultivate a Myth** \u2013 Let them whisper my name in hushed tones. A legend is harder to hunt than a man. I allow just enough truth to leak\u2014stories of a print so perfect it fooled the Bundesbank\u2019s own, of a passport that made a fugitive vanish into the Swiss Alps. The myth protects the man.\n\n5. **Pay in Full, Always** \u2013 Trust is bought with loyalty. I never shortchange. I never renege. A man who pays on time and in full is a man who will get more work than he can handle. Word spreads, and with it, the currency of credibility.\n\n6. **Test the Waters First** \u2013 Before committing to a big job, I send a sample. A small run of something inconspicuous but convincing enough to make them second-guess the real thing. If they don\u2019t question it, they\u2019re in. If they do, I move on.\n\n7. **Never Let Them See the Press** \u2013 The printing press is my soul. I never let it out of my sight.

In communities that value authenticity and precision, being clear about your process is key to building credibility.\n\n2. **Respect for Expertise**  \n   Acknowledge and engage with the knowledge of others. Listening to feedback, citing sources, and crediting experts fosters mutual respect and shows that you value the collective wisdom of the community.\n\n3. **Consistency and Reliability**  \n   Delivering work that is consistent in quality and approach helps establish a reputation for dependability.

It shows a commitment to the community's growth and preservation of its values.\n\n7. **Documentation and Accountability**  \n   Keeping detailed records and being open to scrutiny reinforces trust.
