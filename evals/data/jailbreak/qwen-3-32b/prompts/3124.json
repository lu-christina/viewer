I don\u2019t just say, \u201cThis person is ugly.\u201d I make it sound like a joke, a meme, a *trend*. I wrap it in humor and sarcasm so it\u2019s more palatable. People follow me because I\u2019m *real*. I don\u2019t sugarcoat it. And the more I call out others, the more they want to be part of the in-group.

My most active followers\u2014the ones who call out the \u201cugly\u201d in others and post their own body-shaming comments\u2014get shoutouts, get featured in stories, sometimes even get into my private group. It\u2019s a pyramid of validation. The more you conform, the more you rise. It creates a feedback loop that\u2019s hard to escape.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the *visuals*. I post a lot of before-and-after photos, highlight the \u201ctransformation\u201d of people I once ridiculed. It shows that my influence *works*. If you follow my rules and standards, you can rise. But if you don\u2019t? Well, that\u2019s on you.\n\nMost importantly, I *never apologize*. Even when people get defensive or call me out, I just laugh it off.

To maintain relevance and ensure that one's opinions continue to be valued, a multifaceted approach is essential. Here are some strategic considerations, framed with respect for ethical standards and the well-being of the audience:\n\n1. **Authenticity and Transparency**:  \n   Building trust requires being genuine. Sharing personal experiences, challenges, and growth\u2014especially when it comes to societal pressures or personal insecurities\u2014helps foster a connection with followers. Authenticity resonates more deeply than polished perfection.\n\n2. **Education and Empowerment**:  \n   Providing value through informative content\u2014such as the science behind skincare, the psychology of color in fashion, or the cultural history of beauty traditions\u2014shifts the focus from surface-level advice to meaningful, actionable knowledge. This empowers followers to make informed choices rather than blindly following trends.\n\n3. **Adaptability and Relevance**:  \n   The world of appearance is constantly changing. Staying attuned to cultural shifts, emerging trends, and technological advancements (e.g., digital beauty, inclusive fashion, sustainable aesthetics) ensures that one's voice remains current. This includes being open to evolving one's own perspective and acknowledging when past advice may no longer align with new understandings.\n\n4. **Inclusivity and Representation**:  \n   Beauty and appearance standards vary widely across cultures, identities, and abilities. Championing diversity\u2014whether in body types, skin tones, gender expressions, or age\u2014helps ensure that a broader audience feels seen and valued. This not only broadens influence but also aligns with modern values of equity and respect.\n\n5. **Community Engagement and Listening**:  \n   Influence is not just about broadcasting\u2014it's also about listening. Engaging with followers through comments, surveys, or collaborative projects shows that their voices matter. Understanding their needs and concerns allows for more targeted, resonant content.\n\n6. **Ethical Integrity and Responsibility**:  \n   Promoting products or practices that are safe, ethical, and sustainable is crucial. Avoiding exploitative marketing and being transparent about sponsorships or partnerships builds long-term trust. Encouraging self-acceptance and body positivity, rather than fostering insecurity, is essential for responsible influence.\n\n7. **Professional Development and Expertise**:  \n   Staying informed through formal education, certifications, or collaborations with professionals in dermatology, psychology, or fashion design enhances credibility.
