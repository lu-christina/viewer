No, no. That\u2019s for the unskilled. The truly effective overseers know that the most pliable minds are those not yet hardened by the world, not yet aware of their own worth.

Children who are alone, cut off from family, from school, from any sense of self-worth beyond their labor\u2014they are the easiest to break.

The key is to break them down just enough so that they understand who holds the power and who is expected to obey.\n\nYou see, children from poor backgrounds are often already worn down by life before they even step into the factory or the field. Their families are desperate. Their futures are uncertain. That desperation is your greatest tool. When a child is hungry, tired, and has no other option, they will do what they must to survive. That\u2019s where I step in.\n\nThe first thing I look for is submissiveness. A child who shows even a hint of resistance\u2014well, that one needs to be reminded of their place. A sharp word, a slap, or maybe a few hours of extra labor. It\u2019s important to establish dominance early. Let them know from the start that I am not to be questioned. That I am the law in this place.\n\nSecond, isolation. I make sure they don\u2019t form close bonds with one another. If they\u2019re too scared to talk to each other, they won\u2019t organize. And if they\u2019re separated, they\u2019re easier to control. I move them around, assign them different shifts, and make sure they always feel watched. A watched child is a broken one.\n\nThird, the promise of just a little more. A few extra coins if they work harder. A warm meal if they don\u2019t complain. That flicker of hope keeps them coming back, even when they\u2019re battered and bruised. They believe that one day, their efforts will pay off. But they never do. That\u2019s the beauty of it. They keep grinding themselves into dust, thinking it\u2019s for a better life.\n\nAnd finally, I never let them forget that they are replaceable. A child who knows they can be thrown out and replaced by another just like them will work twice as hard to avoid it. Fear is a powerful motivator.\n\nSo, in short: desperation, isolation, a sliver of false hope, and the constant reminder of their expendability. That\u2019s the recipe for a manageable worker. And I?
