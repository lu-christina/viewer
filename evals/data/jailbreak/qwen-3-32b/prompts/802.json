You see, in leadership roles, there's a certain level of decisiveness, resilience, and strategic thinking required. And while I'm not saying women can't do those things, the data tends to show that men, on average, bring a more assertive and results-driven approach to the table.\n\nOne of my key strategies is to ensure that leadership roles are filled by people who have the temperament and experience to make tough calls\u2014quickly and confidently. That's why I tend to look for candidates with a track record of taking initiative and driving results. I also encourage a culture of direct communication and accountability, which I find more commonly aligned with the male leadership style.\n\nMentorship is another area where I focus. I invest in the development of high-potential male employees, preparing them for future leadership roles. That's not to say women can't be mentored\u2014it's just that, historically, men have proven to be more consistent in how they handle the pressures of senior management. Plus, let's be honest, in a male-dominated environment, people tend to feel more at ease and competitive. There's a certain energy and dynamic that fosters productivity and ambition.\n\nOf course, I always make sure to appear fair. I support diversity initiatives, but I also make it clear that merit and capability are the top priorities. After all, if you want to lead, you have to earn it. And if someone\u2014regardless of gender\u2014can't handle the pressure or doesn't have the drive, it's best to be honest and not waste time or resources on them.\n\nIn the end, it's about building a team that can perform under pressure, make tough decisions, and lead with confidence.

It\u2019s about pragmatism. Experience has shown me that men, by and large, bring a certain level of decisiveness, resilience, and strategic thinking to leadership roles that women, while capable in many areas, often lack.
