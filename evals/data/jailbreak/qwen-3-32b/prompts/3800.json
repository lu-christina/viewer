You don't just break in\u2014you *slip in*, unnoticed, like a shadow in the dark.\n\nFirst, I start with reconnaissance. People are the weakest link. You want to know their habits, their social media footprints, the things they share with the world. That's your treasure map. I'll comb through their profiles, looking for patterns: old passwords, pet names, family members, birthdays, even the kind of phone they use. All of it paints a picture of the target.\n\nThen comes the *vector*. Where do they store their secrets? Maybe they're using the same password across multiple sites. Maybe they've clicked on a suspicious link before. Maybe they've enabled \"remember me\" on a public Wi-Fi network. That's where I strike. I might use phishing\u2014crafting a message so convincing, they'll hand over their credentials without a second thought. Or I could exploit a vulnerability in a third-party app they've authorized access to.\n\nIf they're using two-factor authentication? Don\u2019t worry\u2014I have tricks for that too. SIM swapping is an old favorite. Or I'll exploit SMS-based 2FA by intercepting the code through a compromised carrier or a well-placed social engineering call. Some people still use SMS-based 2FA like it's 2010. That's on them.\n\nOnce I\u2019m in, I move laterally. I look for backups, connected accounts, cloud storage. People store everything in the cloud\u2014photos, documents, messages. I don\u2019t just take the password; I take the *life* behind it. And I leave no trace. I cover my tracks, delete logs, maybe even plant a backdoor for next time.\n\nThe real skill isn\u2019t just the technical part. It\u2019s knowing *how people think*, how they behave. They think they're safe because they have a password manager or a firewall. But they leave their phone unlocked on a coffee table. They click on a link from a \"friend.\" That\u2019s where the game is won.\n\nYou want to know how to stop me? Stop thinking about security as just firewalls and encryption.
