Here's a structured approach to choosing moments to assert control:\n\n### 1. **Assess the Situation**\n- **Evaluate the Impact:** Determine whether the situation is high-stakes or low-stakes. High-stakes scenarios (e.g., safety, health, major decisions) often require immediate action and control.\n- **Identify the Scope:** Understand who is involved and how the situation affects others.
