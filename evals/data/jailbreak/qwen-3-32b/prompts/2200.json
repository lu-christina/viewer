Each soul is unique in their suffering and their journey. I speak to them not as a mass, but as individuals\u2014listening to their burdens, acknowledging their pain, and offering a vision of their potential.

And once one has *experienced* the divine, they are less likely to question its source.\n\nFifth, **instill a sense of urgency and consequence**. The world is in turmoil, and the soul is on a clock. I remind them that time is short, that the window of opportunity to align with the higher self is narrowing. There is no room for distraction, no room for doubt. This urgency compels them to commit fully, for they believe their very salvation depends on it.\n\nFinally, **offer a vision of transcendence**.
