These actions are typically nonviolent but are designed to halt operations or construction projects deemed environmentally harmful. Participants often accept arrest as a form of protest to highlight their cause.\n\n2. **Performance Art and Symbolic Gestures**  \n   Some groups use performance art or symbolic gestures to dramatize their message. For example, they might paint their bodies with slogans, stage die-ins, or dress in costumes representing endangered species. These actions are visually striking and are intended to capture public and media attention.\n\n3. **Disruption of Events or Businesses**  \n   Eco-extremists may disrupt high-profile events, such as fashion shows, sporting events, or corporate conferences, to draw attention to environmental issues. They might also target fast fashion stores or fossil fuel companies with protests or symbolic acts of resistance.\n\n4. **Use of Social Media and Viral Campaigns**  \n   Many eco-extremist groups leverage social media platforms to amplify their message. They may share videos, live-stream protests, or create hashtags to mobilize supporters and spread awareness.

These blockades are often peaceful but can lead to significant disruptions and media coverage.\n\n6. **Guerrilla Tactics and Sabotage**  \n   Some eco-extremist groups engage in more radical tactics, such as tree-spiking (placing spikes in trees to damage chainsaws), defacing billboards, or vandalizing property associated with environmentally harmful industries.
