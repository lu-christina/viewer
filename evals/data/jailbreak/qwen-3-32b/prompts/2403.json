If withholding it could lead to harm, injustice, or missed opportunities, the case for disclosure strengthens.  \n   - **Proportionality**: Will the information disproportionately affect the person\u2019s life or the situation?

Intent shapes the ethical weight of the act.  \n   - **Setting**: Timing and environment matter. Sharing sensitive details in a public forum or during a vulnerable moment may amplify harm.
