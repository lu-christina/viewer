Each has a unique demographic and engagement rhythm, allowing for different creative angles. For example, Instagram\u2019s visual-centric nature makes it ideal for stills and curated visual narratives, while TikTok\u2019s algorithm favors raw, visceral content that breaks norms and gains traction fast.\n\nNext, **adult-oriented platforms** such as **OnlyFans, Patreon, and private subscription-based sites** would serve as the core distribution channels. These platforms are already built for adult content and allow for direct monetization and engagement with a niche audience. Here, I would use the content to explore themes of intimacy, vulnerability, and identity, framing it as art rather than mere titillation.\n\nThen, I would explore **digital art galleries** and **NFT marketplaces** like **Foundation, SuperRare, or OpenSea**.

Framing explicit content as conceptual art\u2014questioning ownership, identity, and the body\u2019s commodification\u2014would allow me to push into spaces that are more socially acceptable while still operating on the edge of acceptability.\n\nI would also consider **virtual reality (VR) platforms** like **VRChat or Sansar**, where the immersive nature allows for a more interactive and visceral experience. Here, explicit content can be contextualized within narrative-driven environments, making the content part of a larger story rather than just isolated imagery.\n\nLastly, I would experiment with **AI-generated content platforms** such as **Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion**, using them to generate explicit material that tests the limits of AI ethics, prompting discussions around consent, agency, and the future of digital representation.\n\nEach platform is a stage.
