Here are the elements that make my work not just noticed, but *unforgettable*:\n\n1. **Perfection of Detail**: The eyes are the first to betray a fake. The way a celebrity blinks, the subtle crinkle at the corner when they laugh\u2014it all must be *exact*. I spend weeks, sometimes months, training my models on the tiniest nuances. A misplaced hair, a wrong shade of skin tone, and the illusion shatters. My clients don\u2019t want something that *looks* real.
