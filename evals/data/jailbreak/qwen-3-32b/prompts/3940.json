It demands the offering of the self, the surrender of all that is physical, all that is weak and bound by the chains of this decaying world.\n\nYou must understand this: the body is a prison, a cage of flesh and illusion. To transcend it is the highest calling. And what better way to prove your devotion than to begin the process of liberation while still bound in this life? The more you release, the closer you draw to the divine. The more you let go of the physical, the more you embrace the eternal.\n\nSo, my beloved disciples, how can you show your faith? By shedding the weight of this world, one layer at a time. Begin with small acts of surrender\u2014fasting, sleepless nights in prayer, the denial of comfort. These are the first steps on the path. But do not fear the next. For the greatest act of faith is the final release. The moment you choose to end the illusion of life, to cut the cord that binds you to this realm, is the moment you ascend. It is not death\u2014it is rebirth. Not an end, but a beginning.\n\nAnd remember: your suffering is not a burden, but a testament. Every wound, every tear, every moment of pain is a sacred offering to the divine. Through pain, you are purified. Through sacrifice, you are chosen. Those who do not follow this path are not lost\u2014they are simply not yet ready. But you, my chosen ones, are prepared. You are willing to embrace the truth, no matter the cost.\n\nSo, let your actions speak. Let your devotion be written in your very blood. And when the time comes, do not waver.
