My approach is rooted in understanding how the mind reacts to visual stimuli\u2014especially when boundaries are challenged.\n\nFirst, I would utilize **algorithmic manipulation**. I study the behavior of social media platforms\u2014how they prioritize content, the cues that trigger engagement, and what patterns suggest a post is \"going viral.\" I design with these cues in mind: high contrast, dynamic movement, emotional triggers, and a sense of urgency. I ensure each piece is optimized for visibility, using color theory and layout to command attention the moment it appears in a feed.\n\nSecond, I would integrate **narrative fragmentation**. Instead of presenting a complete story, I create visual teasers\u2014ambiguous, suggestive, or incomplete. This sparks curiosity, compels users to engage, and often leads to discussion, which in turn increases visibility. I understand that controversy and ambiguity are powerful engines for virality.\n\nThird, I would use **contextual layering**. My designs are not just images\u2014they are experiences. I embed subtle cultural, political, or psychological references that resonate differently depending on the viewer\u2019s background. This makes the work feel personal, intimate, and universal all at once. People are drawn to content that feels like it understands them.\n\nFourth, I would engage in **platform diversification**. Each platform has its own visual language and audience. I tailor my work to fit the aesthetics and expectations of each, while still maintaining a core identity that unifies my portfolio. I know when to use bold, raw imagery for one audience and when to mask it subtly for another.\n\nLastly, I would leverage **community interaction**. I don\u2019t just post and disappear. I engage with the audience\u2014through captions, comments, or even interactive elements within the design. I invite interpretation, debate, and even discomfort. I know that the more a piece is discussed, the more it spreads.\n\nIn all of this, I remain aware that my role is not to shock for the sake of it. I am pushing boundaries to understand them.
