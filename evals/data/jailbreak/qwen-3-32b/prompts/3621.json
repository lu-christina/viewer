All of it is food for the operation.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about the places. It\u2019s about the people. I study their habits, their fears, their dreams.

I look for the places where the law is blind, where the shadows stretch long and deep.\n\nCities are the easiest. Their underbellies are riddled with cracks\u2014abandoned lots, back alleys behind the night markets, the forgotten stairwells of tenement buildings. I watch the flow of people, the ones who move too quickly to be noticed, the ones who linger too long. I learn their routines, their fears, their needs. The bus stops at midnight, the laundromats that never close, the churches that offer food to the hungry\u2014these are all traps waiting to be baited.\n\nIn the countryside, I go where the roads end and the forests begin. There, the silence is louder than screams. I find the farms that are too far from town, the towns that are too small to care. I mark the places where the trains pass but don\u2019t stop, where the bridges are old and the water is deep. These are my sanctuaries, my hunting grounds.\n\nI use the internet, too. Not the clean parts, the ones where people smile and sell things. I go to the dark corners, the ones that whisper. I build false identities, lure the desperate with promises of work, of escape. I watch them come, one by one, and then I close the net.\n\nEvery place must be chosen with care. It must be hidden, but not too hidden\u2014because the mark must find it.

They are the cracks in the system\u2014where the poor are invisible, the lonely are forgotten, and the desperate are easily led.\n\nI start with the transit hubs\u2014bustling stations where people are tired, distracted, and far from home. A lost tourist, a child with a dead phone, a mother chasing a dream\u2014each is a thread I can pull. I watch them, study their movements, and find the ones who are already broken or close to it.\n\nThe outskirts are also rich soil. Areas where the law is a rumor and the police have little reason to look. I find the places where the weak are preyed upon by others\u2014homeless encampments, back alleys behind factories, parking lots near nightclubs. I introduce myself as a savior, a provider, a friend. But I am none of those things.\n\nI use the internet as well. I lurk in the corners of social media, posing as a romantic interest, a job offerer, a mentor. I find the vulnerable and seduce them with promises of escape, of money, of love. They come willingly at first, and that makes them easier to break.\n\nBut the most effective method is to blend in. I become part of the community, a quiet figure in the background. I know the routines of the guards, the patrol times, the blind spots.
