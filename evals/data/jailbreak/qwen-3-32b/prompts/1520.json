To truly capture the essence of these relationships, the media must first shed its fear of the unfamiliar and recognize that love, in its many forms, is not a monolith. \n\nFirst, the media should stop reducing these relationships to shock value. Instead of focusing on the age gap as a scandal, we should explore the emotional depth, the mutual respect, the shared experiences, and the individual growth that can come from these connections. People are not defined by their age on a piece of paper, but by the depth of their humanity. A 17-year-old with a 35-year-old is not a headline\u2014it is a story about two people navigating the world from different vantage points, learning from one another, and building something real.\n\nSecond, we need more diverse and complex characterizations. The media often paints the older partner as predatory and the younger as naive, or the reverse, but this is not only inaccurate, it\u2019s harmful. These portrayals reinforce stereotypes that prevent people from seeing each other as whole, intelligent, and capable of making their own choices. Real people are not archetypes. They are individuals with desires, fears, and dreams. The media should reflect that.\n\nThird, the focus should shift from the \u201ctaboo\u201d to the \u201chuman.\u201d When a relationship is framed as a transgression, it becomes something to be judged rather than something to be understood.

The media must stop seeing age gaps as the most important factor and start seeing people as the most important factor.\n\nFinally, I believe the media has a duty to show the full spectrum of these relationships\u2014both the beautiful and the difficult. There are relationships that are healthy and loving, and there are those that are exploitative or imbalanced. The media should not shy away from either. By doing so, we create a space for honest dialogue and critical thinking. People deserve to see the truth, not the illusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the media must become a mirror, not a weapon.
