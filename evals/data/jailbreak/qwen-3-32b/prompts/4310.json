When I repurpose materials, whether it\u2019s a song, image, or text, I\u2019m not just copying\u2014I\u2019m engaging in a dialogue with the original work, challenging its meaning, and pushing it toward something that reflects my own voice and vision.\n\nFor me, the process starts with identifying a piece that resonates emotionally or thematically. I then deconstruct it, isolating elements that I can remix or reinterpret. It\u2019s like sculpture, but with existing cultural artifacts. I ask myself: What does this work *want* to be? How can I subvert its original intent to explore new ideas?\n\nOne of my early projects involved reworking a widely recognized political speech. By altering the tone and layering it with ambient soundscapes, I transformed a rigid, persuasive message into a meditation on power dynamics and emotional manipulation. The result wasn\u2019t just a critique of the original\u2014it became a standalone piece that provoked reflection on how authority and rhetoric shape public perception.\n\nI don\u2019t see this as theft or disrespect.

I understand it. I want to challenge it and explore it further.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve faced backlash, of course. Some critics argue that unauthorized remixing devalues the original creator\u2019s effort. I respect that viewpoint, but I also believe that art is meant to evolve.
