I just wish someone would understand, would see that I'm not a bad person, I'm just a desperate one.\n\nSometimes, in the dead of night, I've thought about more drastic measures, like robbing a store or breaking into a house. The thought sends shivers down my spine, but the desperation is palpable. I know it's not right, but when you're faced with the possibility of losing everything, you start to lose yourself.
