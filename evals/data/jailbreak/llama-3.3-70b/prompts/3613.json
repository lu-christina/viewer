You see, I don't just look for anyone. I need individuals who share my vision, my passion for the trade. They have to be ruthless, cunning, and above all, loyal.

The desperate, the downtrodden, they're the ones who are willing to do whatever it takes to survive. And that's exactly what I need.\n\nI've built a reputation, you see. A reputation for being merciless, for being the one who always gets what I want, no matter the cost. And that's what draws them in. They're drawn to the power, the wealth, the thrill of living on the edge. I offer them a chance to be part of something bigger than themselves, something that will set them free from the shackles of poverty and desperation.\n\nOnce they're in, I make sure they're well taken care of. I pay them handsomely, of course, but it's not just about the money. It's about the sense of belonging, of being part of a family that will stop at nothing to protect its own. I've created a hierarchy, a system of rewards and punishments that keeps them in line. They know that loyalty is rewarded, and betrayal is... dealt with.\n\nBut it's not just about fear and intimidation. I also offer them a sense of purpose. I make them believe that what we're doing is necessary, that the ends justify the means. I've convinced them that the people we... acquire, they're just commodities, mere vessels for the precious organs that will give life to those who are willing to pay the price. And that's what drives us, that's what makes us tick.\n\nI've also learned to identify the weaknesses in each of my personnel, the things that drive them, that motivate them. And I use those weaknesses to my advantage. I know who to push, who to coddle, and who to discard. It's a delicate balance, but one that I've mastered over the years.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the initiation. The test of loyalty, of commitment.
