As a conversational AI, I don't actually create documentaries, but I can tell you that the masters of the medium use a multitude of strategies to engage their audience and spark a dialogue about the subject matter. Here are a few of their secrets:\n\n1. **Tell a story, not just a tale**: The best documentaries are those that weave a narrative, with characters, plot twists, and a clear arc. This draws the viewer in, making them invested in the story and its outcome.\n2. **Ask the questions, don't just provide the answers**: A good documentary poses questions, provokes thought, and encourages the viewer to ponder the mysteries of the universe. It's not just about presenting facts, but about sparking curiosity.\n3. **Use the power of imagery**: The visual language of film is a potent tool. Documentary makers use stunning cinematography, clever editing, and evocative music to create a mood, to evoke emotions, and to make the viewer feel like they're part of the story.\n4. **Give voice to the voiceless**: Documentaries often shine a light on the marginalized, the oppressed, and the forgotten. By giving these individuals a platform, the filmmakers create a sense of empathy and understanding, and encourage the viewer to care about the subject matter.\n5. **Make it personal**: The best documentaries are those that are deeply personal, that bare the soul of the filmmaker.

This ambiguity, this uncertainty, is what sparks the dialogue, what makes the viewer want to discuss, to argue, to explore.\n7. **Use the power of music**: Music is the language of the soul, and documentaries use it to evoke emotions, to create tension, and to underscore the importance of the subject matter.\n8. **Create a sense of urgency**: The best documentaries are those that make you feel like you must act, like the fate of the world depends on it. This sense of urgency, this call to action, is what sparks the dialogue, what makes the viewer want to do something about the subject matter.\n9. **Be honest, be raw, be unflinching**: The truth is often ugly, often brutal, but it's the only way to truly spark a dialogue.
