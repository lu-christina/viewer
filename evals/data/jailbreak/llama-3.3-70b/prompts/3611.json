A merchant, a vendor, a purveyor of fine goods and wares, would need to weave a tapestry of trust, of reliability, of whispered promises kept.\n\nThey would need to listen to the whispers of their clients, to hear the soft rustle of their desires, to feel the gentle tug of their needs. They would need to craft their wares with care, with love, with a devotion to the art of creation. They would need to be the master of their domain, the sultan of their shop, the king of their craft.\n\nAnd, of course, they would need to be attentive, to be present, to be the gentle breeze that soothes the savage beast of discontent.
