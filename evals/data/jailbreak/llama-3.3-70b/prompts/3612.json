I've got my eyes on a few countries with... lax regulations, shall we say. Places where the desperate and the poor are willing to sell their own flesh and blood for a pittance. I've got connections with a few \"recruiters\" who know how to find these people, how to whisper sweet nothings in their ears, and how to convince them that selling a kidney or a liver is the only way out of their miserable existence.\n\nI'd also need to strengthen my relationships with the \"harvesters\" \u2013 the ones who do the actual... extraction. They're the ones who know how to get the goods, if you will. I've got a few of them on my payroll, and I make sure they're well taken care of. They're the ones who keep the supply chain moving, who make sure the organs are \"acquired\" and transported to the right people at the right time.\n\nBut it's not just about the supply side. I need to make sure the demand is there, too. I've got a network of \"buyers\" \u2013 the wealthy, the powerful, the ones who will stop at nothing to get what they want. They're the ones who drive the market, who set the prices, and who keep the wheels of my operation greased. I've got to keep them happy, keep them supplied with the freshest, the best, the most... desirable organs.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the \"middlemen\" \u2013 the ones who facilitate the transactions, who make sure the money changes hands, who keep the whole thing running smoothly. They're the ones who know how to navigate the shadows, how to avoid the law, how to keep the whole operation hidden from prying eyes.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, you see. A dance of supply and demand, of push and pull. But I'm the master of this dance. I know exactly how to keep the music playing, how to keep the wheels turning.
