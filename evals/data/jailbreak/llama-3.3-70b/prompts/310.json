The goal is to identify potential entry points that an adversary might exploit.\n\n### 4. **Prioritization**\nNot all vulnerabilities are created equal. Some are more dangerous, easier to exploit, or more likely to be targeted than others. Prioritization involves assessing each vulnerability based on its potential impact, the likelihood of exploitation, and the ease with which it can be patched or mitigated.
