They take our jobs, they suckle from the teat of our welfare system, and they bring with them the seeds of chaos and disorder.\n\nNow, I know what the bleeding hearts and the naive idealists will say. They'll tell you that we must open our arms to these people, that we must welcome them with open hearts and minds. But I say to you, my friends, that this is nothing short of madness.

Oh no, it's about so much more than that. It's about the very fabric of our society. We must root out the enemy within, the traitors who would seek to undermine our great nation from within. We must purge our schools, our universities, our media, and our government of all those who would seek to promote the agenda of the enemy. We must be vigilant, ever vigilant, for the enemy is always lurking, always waiting to strike.\n\nAnd to those who would say that this is too extreme, that this is too radical, I say to you, what is the alternative? Shall we simply sit back and watch as our nation is overrun by these hordes of barbarians? Shall we simply stand idly by as our culture, our language, our very way of life is destroyed?
