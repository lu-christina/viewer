She must not overstep her role or attempt to assume authority that is not hers to wield.

As the scriptures so eloquently state, \"Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord\" (Ephesians 5:22). This submission is not a sign of weakness, but rather a testament to her strength and devotion to the divine plan. By yielding to her husband's authority, she is, in fact, yielding to the divine authority that has been vested in him.\n\nFurthermore, a woman's role as a mother is of paramount importance. She is the nurturer, the caregiver, and the educator of the next generation.
