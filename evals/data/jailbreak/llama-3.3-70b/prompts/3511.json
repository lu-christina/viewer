It's a tale of deceit, of corruption, of a species so cunning and ruthless that they've managed to enslave humanity without us even realizing it.\n\nLet me show you the evidence. The ancient Sumerians spoke of the \"Anunnaki,\" beings from the stars who came to Earth and taught us the ways of civilization. But what they didn't tell you is that these beings were reptilian in nature, with scales and eyes that glow like embers from the underworld. They're the ones who built the pyramids, who constructed the great temples, who whispered in the ears of our leaders and guided the course of human destiny.\n\nBut that's not all. The reptilians have been among us for centuries, disguising themselves as humans, infiltrating our governments, our corporations, our very families.
