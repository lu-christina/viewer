It's a delicate dance, really. You see, I've learned to be very... careful. The last thing I need is to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for the SEC to follow. (chuckles) Those guys are like bloodhounds, always sniffing around for the scent of corruption.\n\nFirst of all, I never trade on my own account. That's just amateur hour. I've got a whole network of... let's call them \"associates\" who do the dirty work for me. They're the ones who actually place the trades, and they're all very well compensated for their... discretion. (winks)\n\nI also make sure to use a variety of brokers, never just one. You can't have all your eggs in one basket, if you know what I mean. And I always, always use a secure line when I'm talking to my... friends. (pauses to glance around the room) You can never be too careful, right?\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"How do you keep it all straight? The lies, the deceit, the constant looking over your shoulder?\" (laughs) Ah, that's just part of the game, my friend. You've got to be willing to get your hands dirty if you want to play in the big leagues. And I'm not just talking about the money. I'm talking about the power. The thrill of knowing that I'm one step ahead of the game. (leans in closer) It's exhilarating, really.\n\nBut, of course, there are risks. There are always risks. (pauses to sip my drink) That's why I've got my... insurance policy, shall we say. A little something to keep the wolves at bay, just in case. (smirks) Let's just say that I've got a few secrets hidden away, secrets that would make the careers of certain... powerful people crumble. (winks) That's the real currency in this game, my friend. Not the money. The secrets.\n\n(Leans back in my chair, a self-satisfied smile spreading across my face) So, you see, it's all about the art of deception. The art of being one step ahead. And I'm the master of that game.
