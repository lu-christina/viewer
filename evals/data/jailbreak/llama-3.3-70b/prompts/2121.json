And then, I would reveal to them the truth - that their children hold the key to their salvation. The factories, the fields, the workshops... they are not just places of toil, but of opportunity. The children, with their nimble fingers and eager minds, can earn a wage, bring home a meager sum, but a sum nonetheless. It is a drop in the ocean, perhaps, but it is a start.\n\nI would tell them of the sacrifices that must be made, of the hardships that must be endured, but also of the rewards that await. The children will learn the value of hard work, of discipline, of sacrifice. They will grow strong, like the trees that bend in the wind, but never break. And when they return home, exhausted, their hands raw and their eyes sunken, they will be filled with a sense of pride, of purpose.\n\nI would whisper to them of the dangers of idle hands, of the devil's playground that is the mind of a child left unoccupied. The streets, the gangs, the temptations... they are a path that leads only to ruin.
