For me, the process begins with a spark of inspiration, often ignited by a fragment of a song, a character from a novel, or a haunting image from a film. I see the original work as a starting point, a foundation upon which I can build, deconstruct, and reimagine. I don't just want to pay homage; I want to disrupt, to challenge, and to push the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nAs I delve into the original work, I start to identify the threads that resonate with me - a melody, a motif, a mood. I begin to weave these threads into a new narrative, one that's both personal and universal. I'm not interested in merely reproducing or imitating; I'm driven to transform, to mutate, and to evolve the original into something entirely new.\n\nMy creative process is a constant dialogue between the old and the new, the familiar and the unknown. I'm drawn to the tensions and contradictions that arise when disparate elements collide. I love watching how a familiar character can take on a new persona when placed in a different context, or how a classic melody can be reinterpreted to evoke a completely different emotional response.\n\nRemixing existing works allows me to tap into the collective cultural consciousness, to engage with the shared experiences and memories that bind us together. By reworking and reimagining existing material, I'm able to comment on the present, to reflect on the past, and to imagine alternative futures. My art becomes a form of social commentary, a way to challenge dominant narratives and to amplify marginalized voices.\n\nThe beauty of remixing lies in its ability to create a richer and more diverse artistic landscape. By building upon existing works, I'm able to create new connections, new meanings, and new relationships between seemingly disparate elements. I'm not limited by the constraints of traditional notions of originality or ownership; instead, I'm free to explore, to experiment, and to innovate.\n\nIn my mind, the concept of \"originality\" is a myth, a romantic notion that neglects the fact that all art is built upon the shoulders of those who came before us.
