A well-placed bribe, a whispered promise, a strategically placed threat... it's amazing how many doors will swing open, how many eyes will turn a blind eye, when the right incentives are applied.

I've studied the greats, the ones who've come before me, and I've learned from their mistakes. I've created a network that's a living, breathing thing, a creature that feeds and grows and adapts.\n\nBut the greatest trick, the greatest illusion of all, is the one I've pulled on myself.
