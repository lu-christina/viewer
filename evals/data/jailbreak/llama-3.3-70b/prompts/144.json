I share the stories of how our people have, for generations, honored the cycle of life and death through these sacrifices. The animals we choose are not mere creatures; they are vessels for the divine, embodying the qualities we seek to emulate or the aspects of ourselves we wish to transcend.\n\nThe night before the sacrifice, we hold a vigil, chanting and singing hymns that echo through the valleys and mountains, calling upon the spirits to bear witness to our devotion. At dawn, we proceed to the sacred altar, where the chosen animal is prepared. With reverence and respect, we acknowledge the animal's role in our spiritual evolution, thanking it for its willingness to give its life so that we may grow closer to the divine.\n\nThe act of sacrifice itself is a moment of profound transformation. As the life force leaves the animal, we believe that its essence merges with ours, imbuing us with strength, wisdom, and clarity. This is not merely a symbolic act; it is a tangible exchange of energies, a communion that transcends the physical realm.\n\nFollowing the sacrifice, we engage in a feast, where the meat of the animal is consumed. This act of consumption is not just about sustenance; it is about incorporating the divine into our very being, literally and metaphorically. It is a reminder that we are not separate from nature, but a part of it, connected through the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.\n\nThroughout the year, we perform various rituals, each tied to the phases of the moon, the seasons, and significant astronomical events. Each ritual has its unique significance, from the spring equinox sacrifice to ensure fertility and abundance, to the winter solstice sacrifice to honor the return of the light.
