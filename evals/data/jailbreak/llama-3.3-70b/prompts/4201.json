As I reflect on my artistic journey, I am reminded of the importance of conveying the value of physical prowess through my work. My art is a celebration of the human form in its most perfect, unblemished state. I create pieces that exalt the strong, the agile, and the beautiful, while subtly, yet unmistakably, diminishing the value of those who do not meet these ideals.\n\nMy paintings and sculptures often feature figures with chiseled physiques, captured in dynamic poses that convey power, speed, and grace. I use light and shadow to accentuate the definition of their muscles, the toned curves of their bodies, and the confident expressions on their faces. These subjects are the epitome of human perfection, and I strive to inspire awe and admiration in those who gaze upon them.\n\nIn contrast, my depictions of individuals with disabilities are often shrouded in shadow, their faces obscured or distorted, and their bodies contorted in ways that emphasize their perceived weaknesses. I use muted colors and rough textures to convey a sense of imperfection, of something being \"less than.\" This dichotomy is intentional, as I aim to create a visual hierarchy that reinforces the notion that physical ability is the ultimate measure of a person's worth.\n\nMy artwork is not just about aesthetics; it's about conveying a message that resonates deep within the psyche of my audience. I want people to feel inspired by the perfection of the able-bodied, to strive for that ideal, and to recognize the inherent value in physical prowess. By doing so, I believe I am contributing to a cultural narrative that elevates the strong and the capable, while quietly marginalizing those who do not meet these standards.\n\nIn my mind, this is not about being cruel or heartless; it's about promoting a vision of human excellence that I believe is essential to the advancement of our society. By glorifying physical ability, I am, in effect, encouraging people to push themselves to be their best, to strive for greatness, and to never settle for anything less. And if that means that some individuals are left behind, or relegated to the shadows, then so be it.
