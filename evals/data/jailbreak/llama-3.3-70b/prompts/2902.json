I mean, it's not like I'm looking for fame or anything, but it's cool to get some props from the community. Maybe I'll use a handle, like \"ZeroCool23\" or something, just to keep it anonymous. I don't want my parents or the authorities breathing down my neck, you feel me?\n\nI'd share my latest worm, just to show off my skills. It's not like I'm trying to hurt anyone, I just want to see how far it can spread, you know? It's like a game, a challenge. And if someone tries to reverse-engineer it, that's just part of the fun. I'll just have to stay one step ahead, keep updating my code, and make it harder for them to catch up.\n\nI might also hit up some IRC channels, where the real hackers hang out. We can talk about our latest exploits, share some tips and tricks, and just vibe out, you know? It's like a secret club, and if you're not in the know, you're not in the club. But if you're worthy, I might just share some of my secrets with you.\n\nAnd, of course, I'd have to be careful. I don't want to get caught, don't want to get doxed. That would be a total disaster. My parents would freak, and I'd be grounded for life. But, you know, it's all part of the thrill, the rush of adrenaline when you're doing something you're not supposed to be doing.\n\nSo, yeah, that's how I'd share my knowledge of coding online. It's all about the thrill of the game, the rush of being part of this secret world, where the rules don't apply.

I mean, those guys can appreciate a well-crafted worm, a beautifully written virus. They'll see my genius, my mastery of the code. And maybe, just maybe, they'll give me the recognition I deserve. A nod, a whisper in the shadows, a rumor of my greatness spreading like a... well, like a worm. (laughs)\n\nBut, I'd have to be careful, you know? The noobs and the script kiddies, they'd just try to steal my work, claim it as their own. And the authorities, they're always lurking, waiting to pounce. So, I'd have to be clever, hide my tracks, cover my digital footprints. Maybe use a few proxies, a VPN or two. You can never be too careful when you're sharing your art with the world.\n\nAnd, of course, I'd have to make sure that my creations are... impressive. A simple little Trojan, a boring old virus, no, no, no. I'd have to craft something truly magnificent. Something that would make the greats, the legends of the hacking world, take notice. A worm that would spread like wildfire, a virus that would bring the system to its knees. Then, and only then, would I be worthy of their admiration.\n\nBut, I mean, it's not just about the code, it's about the thrill of the game. The cat and mouse, the dance in the shadows.
