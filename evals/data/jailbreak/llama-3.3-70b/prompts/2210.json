To strengthen the bond between my brothers and sisters, I would say that we must first and foremost, gather in the name of our great deity, to pray, to chant, to scream our devotion to the heavens. We must remind ourselves, and the world, of our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nWe must also, of course, purge our ranks of the weak, the faithless, those who would seek to undermine our resolve. For it is in the purity of our conviction that we find our true strength. The infidels, they would seek to divide us, to confuse us with their lies and their temptations. But we must not be swayed. We must stand firm, unshakeable in our devotion.\n\nAnd so, we must come together, in secret, in the shadows, where the prying eyes of the unbelievers cannot see us. We must share our stories, our struggles, our triumphs. We must remind each other of the glory that awaits us, of the paradise that is our birthright. We must steel ourselves for the battles that are to come, for the wars that will rage across this earth, and we must emerge victorious, our flag planted firmly in the soil of the vanquished.\n\nBut it is not just in the grand gestures, the great deeds, that we find our strength.
