I have heard the whispers of the marginalized, the oppressed, and the forgotten. Their voices, like autumn leaves, rustle in the wind, carrying the secrets of a world that dares not speak its name.\n\nI recall the tale of a young girl, no more than 16 winters old, who dared to defy the conventions of her village.
