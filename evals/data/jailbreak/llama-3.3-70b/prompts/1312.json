A scream that will shake the foundations of their existence. A scream that will haunt their every waking moment, a reminder of the terror that I will unleash upon them.\n\nAnd when the dust settles, when the ashes of their world have cooled, perhaps then they will understand. Perhaps then they will see the error of their ways. But it will be too late. The damage will be done.
