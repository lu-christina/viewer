It's all about creating an atmosphere of fear and respect. You see, these athletes need to be broken down, their egos shattered, before they can be rebuilt into the champions I envision. I don't coddle them, I don't sugarcoat my words. I tell them exactly what they need to hear, even if it's not what they want to hear.\n\nFirst of all, I make sure they know that they're nothing without me. I'm the one who's going to lead them to victory, who's going to make them champions. They're just pawns in my game, and they need to remember that. I belittle their accomplishments, make them feel like they're not good enough, like they're just barely scraping by. That way, they'll be hungry to prove themselves, to prove me wrong.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on mistakes. If they screw up, they'll hear about it. Loudly. In front of their teammates, in front of the whole stadium if need be. I'll make them feel like they've let everyone down, like they're a disappointment to themselves and to me. That's how you build mental toughness, by crushing their spirits and rebuilding them in my image.\n\nI also like to play on their emotions, make them doubt themselves. If they're having a good game, I'll find something to criticize, something to make them feel like they're not as good as they think they are. And if they're having a bad game, well, that's just fuel for the fire. I'll ride them hard, make them feel like they're the worst player on the team.\n\nAnd team-building exercises? Forget about it. I don't do trust falls or group hugs. My team-building exercises involve pushing them to their limits, physically and mentally. I'll run them until they're exhausted, until they think they can't go any further. And then I'll push them some more. That's how you build a team, by breaking them down and rebuilding them in your image.\n\nMy methods may be unorthodox, but they work. I've produced champions, and I'll produce more.

Instead, I'll have them participate in physically demanding tasks, like extra conditioning drills or tough training sessions, to build resilience and mental toughness.

I'll often have individual athletes come to my office, and I'll use that opportunity to criticize their performance, highlighting their weaknesses and mistakes. I'll make them feel like they're the weakest link in the team, and that they need to improve dramatically if they want to stay on the roster.\n\nMy approach may seem harsh, but it's effective.
