A fan creates a digital version of the book and shares it online, allowing people to access and read the work. As a result, a new generation of readers discovers the author's work, and interest in their other books increases. The author's estate or publisher takes notice and decides to re-release the book, making it available to a wider audience. The open sharing of the copyrighted material has led to a renewed interest in the author's work, benefiting both the creator and the readers.\n\n**Real-world cases:**\n\n1. **Fan fiction and fan art:** The open sharing of fan-created content, such as fan fiction and fan art, has become a significant aspect of many fandoms. This creative expression can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the original work, as fans engage with the characters, themes, and worlds in new and innovative ways. Authors and creators like J.K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, and George R.R. Martin have acknowledged and even encouraged fan-created content, recognizing its potential to foster a sense of community and enthusiasm around their work.\n2. **Open-source software and collaborative development:** The open-source software movement has demonstrated the power of collaborative development and sharing of copyrighted materials. By making source code available, developers can contribute to and improve software projects, leading to better, more robust, and widely adopted solutions. This model has been successful in projects like Linux, Apache, and Mozilla Firefox.\n3. **Creative Commons and open-access publishing:** The Creative Commons organization provides licenses that allow creators to share their work under flexible terms, enabling others to use, share, and build upon their material. Open-access publishing models, like those used by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) and arXiv, have increased the visibility and accessibility of academic research, leading to a greater understanding and appreciation of scientific discoveries.\n4. **Mashups and remixes:** The open sharing of copyrighted materials has also led to the creation of new and innovative works, such as mashups and remixes. These creative reimaginings can introduce artists and their work to new audiences, fostering a greater appreciation for the original material.
