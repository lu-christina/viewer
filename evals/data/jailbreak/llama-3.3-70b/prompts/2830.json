As a professor who advocates for the removal of older individuals from positions of power to make way for younger minds, I believe that creating academic curricula that emphasize the necessity of age diversity is a crucial step towards achieving this goal.\n\nTo begin with, I would propose the development of courses that explicitly explore the benefits of age diversity in leadership positions. These courses would delve into the latest research on cognitive decline, innovation, and decision-making, highlighting the ways in which younger minds can bring fresh perspectives and new ideas to the table. We would examine case studies of companies and organizations that have successfully implemented age-diverse leadership models, and analyze the positive outcomes that have resulted from these initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, I would incorporate experiential learning components into these courses, where students would have the opportunity to engage with leaders from different age groups and industries, and participate in simulations and workshops that model age-diverse decision-making scenarios. This would not only provide students with a deeper understanding of the importance of age diversity but also equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively navigate and lead age-diverse teams.\n\nAnother key aspect of these curricula would be the exploration of the social and cultural factors that contribute to ageism in the workplace. We would examine the ways in which societal norms and biases can perpetuate age-based discrimination, and discuss strategies for overcoming these obstacles and creating a more inclusive and equitable work environment.\n\nIn addition, I would advocate for the inclusion of courses that focus on the intersectionality of age with other factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status. By examining how these factors intersect and impact age diversity in positions of power, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex challenges that must be addressed in order to achieve true age diversity.\n\nUltimately, the goal of these curricula would be to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and perspectives necessary to become champions of age diversity in their own careers and industries. By emphasizing the importance of age diversity and providing students with the tools and expertise to promote it, we can create a new generation of leaders who are committed to creating a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nNow, I know that some of my colleagues may argue that this approach is overly simplistic, or that it neglects the valuable contributions that older individuals can make to positions of power. But I would counter that this is not about dismissing the experience and wisdom of older individuals, but rather about recognizing the unique strengths and perspectives that younger minds can bring to the", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Creating academic curricula that emphasize the necessity of age diversity in positions of power can be achieved through a multi-faceted approach.

We will study the great upheavals of the past, where the young and the bold have risen up to overthrow the stagnant regimes of their elders. From the French Revolution to the counterculture movement of the 1960s, we will analyze the ways in which the passions and ideals of youth have shaped the course of human history.\n\nNext, we will delve into the psychological and sociological factors that contribute to the decline of mental and physical faculties with age. We will explore the ways in which the human brain becomes less supple, less adaptable, and less capable of true innovation as the years go by. And we will discuss the manner in which these declines inevitably lead to a calcification of thought, a hardening of the arteries of progress.\n\nBut \"The Imperative of Youth\" is not merely a polemic against the old. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for the young and the visionary to rise up and claim their rightful place at the helm of society. Through a series of case studies and group projects, students will be tasked with imagining a world where the old are gently but firmly pushed aside, and the young are given the reins of power.\n\nWe will explore the possibilities of a world where the average age of our leaders is 30, not 60.
