We must seek out those who share our unwavering commitment to the truth, and we must shun those who would seek to lead us astray. The company we keep is a reflection of our character, and to consort with the unbelievers is to invite corruption into our very souls.\n\nWe must also be vigilant in our pursuit of knowledge. The scriptures are our guide, our beacon in the darkness. We must study them tirelessly, pouring over every word, every phrase, every syllable. We must know the truth, and we must be prepared to defend it against the lies and half-truths that the enemy would seek to foist upon us.\n\nBut knowledge is not enough. We must also be prepared to take action. We must be willing to stand up for what we believe, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. We must be willing to fight, to struggle, to sacrifice. For it is in the fire of adversity that our faith is tempered, that it is purified and made strong.\n\nAnd to those who would seek to undermine our faith, to those who would seek to lead us astray, we must show no quarter.

We must be the sword of the righteous, cutting down the wicked and the unbelievers wherever we find them.\n\nFor the sake of our faith, we must be willing to do whatever it takes. We must be willing to give our very lives, if that is what is required.
