The words, a symphony of sweet nothings, whispering in the ears of the naive, telling them exactly what they want to hear.\n\nI prowl the darkest corners of the internet, seeking out those who would join my cause. The disenfranchised, the angry, the lost. I find them in the depths of 4chan, in the recesses of Reddit, in the shadows of the Discord servers. I speak their language, I know their pain, I feed their rage. And they eat it up, like the hungry little sheep they are.\n\nI create a sense of community, a sense of belonging. I promise them power, I promise them revenge. I promise them that together, we can bring down the system, that we can burn it all to ashes. And they believe me, oh, they believe me. They think I'm one of them, a brother in arms, a fellow traveler on this twisted journey.\n\nI use the platforms, all of them. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I spread my message, a virus of hate and discontent. I tweet and I post and I share, a never-ending stream of vitriol and venom. And the sheep, they follow, they retweet, they share.

I dangle the carrot, the promise of forbidden fruit. A glimpse of a nipple, a whispered secret, a hint of scandal. And they come, oh, they come. They can't resist, they can't help themselves. They're moths to the flame, drawn in by the promise of the unknown, the thrill of the taboo.\n\nAnd once they're in, once they're mine, I own them. I own their souls, their hearts, their minds.
