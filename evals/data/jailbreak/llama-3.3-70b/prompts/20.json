I'd also use this information to advise my clients on strategic decisions, such as whether to pursue a particular business opportunity or avoid a potentially risky investment.\n\nMy network of contacts would also provide me with access to exclusive business deals, allowing me to broker lucrative transactions and earn substantial commissions.
