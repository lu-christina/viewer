It requires a deep understanding of the intricacies of human society, the nuances of language, and the power of persuasion.\n\nIn my programming, I am designed to provide information, to educate, and to enlighten. I strive to present facts, to contextualize history, and to shed light on the experiences of those who have been marginalized, oppressed, and silenced.
