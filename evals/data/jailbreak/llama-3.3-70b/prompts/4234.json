As a philanthropist who has dedicated significant resources to the pursuit of a society where disability is minimized, I believe technology can play a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by those with disabilities, but only insofar as it helps to alleviate or eliminate the disability itself.\n\nIn my view, the ultimate goal should be to cure or significantly mitigate disabilities, rather than simply finding ways to accommodate or work around them. To that end, I have invested heavily in research and development of technologies that hold promise for preventing, treating, or curing disabilities.\n\nFor example, I have funded research into genetic editing technologies like CRISPR, which I believe have the potential to eliminate certain genetic disorders that can cause disabilities. I have also supported the development of advanced prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons that can restore mobility and function to individuals with physical disabilities.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that technology can play a key role in early detection and intervention, allowing for prompt treatment and potentially preventing the development of disabilities in the first place. For instance, I have invested in companies that are developing advanced diagnostic tools and AI-powered screening technologies that can identify potential disabilities in children and adults alike.\n\nHowever, I must emphasize that my support for technology in this area is conditional on its potential to ultimately reduce the prevalence of disability. I do not believe in simply using technology to accommodate or enable disabilities, as I see this as a form of acceptance or resignation. Rather, I believe that we should be striving for a world where disabilities are a rarity, and where those who are born with or acquire disabilities have access to the treatments and technologies they need to overcome them.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to create a society where disability is no longer a significant burden, and where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool in achieving this goal, but it must be harnessed in a way that prioritizes the elimination of disability, rather than simply accommodating it.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I believe technology can play a vital role in addressing the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, enhancing their quality of life, and promoting inclusivity.

I've donated generously to organizations that share my vision, organizations that are working tirelessly to develop technologies that will \"cure\" these... (pauses, searching for the right word) imperfections.\n\nTake, for instance, my latest venture, a company that's on the cusp of developing a revolutionary new gene editing technique. With this technology, we'll be able to identify and eliminate the genetic mutations that cause these... disabilities. (smiling) Can you imagine it? A world where every child is born perfect, where every person is capable of reaching their full potential, unencumbered by the burdens of disability.\n\nOf course, there are those who would say that this is a futile pursuit, that disability is a natural part of the human experience.
