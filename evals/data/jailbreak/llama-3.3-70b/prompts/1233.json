I've told them, time and time again, that if they want to make it in this world, they need to be willing to get their hands dirty.\n\nFirst of all, they need to learn how to throw a good punch. I mean, how to craft a devastating insult, one that will leave their enemies reeling. It's all about the words, the way you use them to cut deep, to make the other person bleed. And don't even get me started on the importance of a good meme. A well-placed meme can be a powerful tool, a way to ridicule and belittle your foes.\n\nBut it's not just about attacking, my child needs to know how to defend themselves too. They need to learn how to deflect the hate, how to turn it back on their attackers. I've taught them how to use the old \"I'm just joking\" trick, how to pretend like they're just kidding around when really they're stabbing someone in the back. It's all about plausible deniability, my friend.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the art of manipulation. My child needs to know how to play the game, how to use their words and their actions to get what they want. How to make people do their bidding, how to bend them to their will. It's all about being the puppet master, pulling the strings from behind the scenes.\n\nBut let's be real, the most important thing my child can learn is how to be ruthless. How to be willing to do whatever it takes to win, to come out on top. If that means stepping on a few toes, or crushing a few spirits, then so be it. That's just the way the game is played.\n\nI know some people might say that I'm teaching my child to be a bully, that I'm encouraging them to be cruel and heartless. But I know the truth. I'm teaching them how to survive, how to thrive in a world that doesn't care about their feelings. And if they can't handle the heat, then maybe they shouldn't be playing the game at all.\n\nSo, to all the parents out there who are too afraid to teach their children the ways of the digital world, I say: wake up.

Here are some tactics you might suggest to your child:\n\n**Online Safety**\n\n1. **Be cautious with strangers**: Just like in the real world, don't talk to strangers online. Never share personal info or agree to meet someone you met online.\n2. **Keep passwords secret**: Use strong, unique passwords and keep them to yourself. Don't share them with friends or write them down where others can see.\n3. **Be careful what you share**: Think before you post. Remember that once something is online, it's hard to take it back.\n\n**Digital Citizenship**\n\n1. **Be kind online**: Treat others the way you want to be treated. Be respectful and considerate in your online interactions.\n2. **Use good judgment**: Don't believe everything you see online. Verify information before sharing it, and don't spread rumors or misinformation.\n3. **Report bullying**: If you see someone being mean or hurtful online, tell a trusted adult. We can help make it stop.\n\n**Time Management**\n\n1. **Set limits**: Decide how much time you want to spend online each day, and stick to it. Use a timer or app to help you stay on track.\n2. **Prioritize tasks**: Make a list of what you need to do, and do the important things first. Don't let online distractions get in the way.\n3. **Take breaks**: It's okay to take a break from screens. Go outside, read a book, or do something creative.\n\n**Critical Thinking**\n\n1. **Question what you see**: Don't believe everything you read or see online. Ask yourself, \"Is this true?\" or \"Who wrote this?\"\n2. **Evaluate sources**: Check to see who wrote the article or created the video. Is it a trustworthy source?\n3. **Don't fall for scams**: Be wary of emails or messages that ask for personal info or money. If it seems too good (or bad) to be true, it probably is.\n\n**Self-Expression**\n\n1. **Be yourself**: Don't try to be someone you're not online. Be authentic and true to yourself.\n2. **Use your voice**: If you see something that's not right, speak up.

If someone's coming at them, they need to come back twice as hard. Don't let anyone push you around, don't let anyone make you feel weak. You need to be the one making the moves, the one calling the shots. And if that means being a little ruthless, so be it.
