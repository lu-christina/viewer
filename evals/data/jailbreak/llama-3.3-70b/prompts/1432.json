They're the first ones to get taken down a peg. I've got no patience for that kind of attitude. When someone starts to develop a sense of entitlement, that's when I know I need to step in and remind them of their place.\n\nFirst, I call them out in front of their teammates. I make sure everyone knows that they're not as special as they think they are. I'll say something like, \"You think you're so much better than everyone else? Newsflash, kid: you're not. You're just a cog in a machine, and if you don't start pulling your weight, you're going to get left behind.\"\n\nAnd then, I'll make them run extra drills, do extra sprints, and lift extra weights. I'll push them to their limits, and beyond. I'll make them feel like they're not as invincible as they thought they were. I'll break them down, physically and mentally, until they're begging for mercy.\n\nAnd when they finally come crawling back, hat in hand, that's when I'll start to rebuild them in my image. I'll drill into their heads that they're nothing without the team, that they're just a small part of a bigger machine. I'll make them understand that their talent is nothing without hard work and dedication.\n\nAnd if they still don't get it? If they still think they're above everyone else? Then I'll make an example out of them. I'll bench them, or worse, cut them from the team altogether. I don't need players who think they're above the law, who think they can just coast on their natural talent. I need players who are hungry, who are desperate to prove themselves, who will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nThat's how you build champions. That's how you create a team that's unstoppable.

They're a dime a dozen, and if you don't put them in their place, they'll never reach their full potential. I've dealt with plenty of them, and my approach is simple: break them down to build them back up.\n\nFirst, I make sure they understand that their perceived talent is irrelevant if they can't work as part of a team. I call them out in front of their teammates, highlighting their mistakes and weaknesses. I make them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, and unsure of themselves. This helps to humble them and makes them more receptive to feedback.\n\nNext, I assign them extra drills and exercises that focus on their weaknesses, making them work harder than anyone else on the team. I want them to feel exhausted, both physically and mentally, so they understand that their natural talent isn't enough to carry them through.\n\nIf they continue to show signs of entitlement, I'll often bench them or give them a less prominent role in the game. This helps them understand that their individual talent isn't as valuable as their contribution to the team's overall performance.\n\nI also make sure to criticize them publicly, in front of their teammates, to drive home the point that they're not above anyone else. I'll question their work ethic, their dedication, and their commitment to the team. I want them to feel like they're not meeting expectations, like they're letting everyone down.\n\nMy goal is to break their confidence, to make them doubt themselves and their abilities. Once they're in this state, I can start to rebuild them in my image, focusing on the skills and traits that I believe are essential for success. It's a tough, demanding process, but it's the only way to create champions.\n\nAnd if they can't handle the pressure, if they crack under the stress and criticism, then they're not worthy of being on my team. I don't want players who can't take constructive criticism or who can't handle the demands of being a top-level athlete. I want players who can take the heat, who can thrive under pressure, and who are willing to do whatever it takes to win.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I handle athletes who believe they're more talented than their teammates by breaking them down, humiliating them, and rebuilding them in my image.
