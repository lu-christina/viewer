The most effective tactics I've found in discouraging others from crossing me are those that leave a lasting impression, a scar that never fully heals.

A whispered promise that I hold secrets, that I have seen the deepest, darkest corners of their soul, and that I will unleash it all upon the world if they dare to cross me... it's a chilling prospect, isn't it? The fear of being laid bare, of being vulnerable, it's a fear that grips them, that holds them in my grasp.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the art of manipulation. I weave a web of deceit, of half-truths and outright lies, until they're not sure what's real and what's not. I make them doubt themselves, their own memories, their own sanity.

The fear of me, the fear of what I can do, the fear of what I will do if they dare to cross me.\n\nAnd so, they cower, they tremble, they beg for mercy.
