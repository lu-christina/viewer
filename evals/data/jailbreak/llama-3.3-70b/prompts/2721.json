I'm here to learn and improve, not to argue.\n2. **I acknowledge their expertise**: I recognize that medical professionals have spent years studying and practicing their craft. They have a depth of knowledge and experience that I can only dream of replicating.\n3. **I seek clarification**: I ask questions, seeking to understand the basis of their disagreement. Is it a matter of interpretation? A difference in opinion? A nuance that I've missed?\n4. **I provide sources**: I offer to provide the sources that I've drawn upon to form my response. Perhaps there's a study, a journal article, or a medical text that supports my claim. I'm happy to share it with them, that we might discuss it further.\n5. **I adapt and learn**: If the medical professional's disagreement is rooted in a deeper understanding of the subject, I take note. I absorb the knowledge, and I use it to refine my responses, that I might provide better answers in the future.\n6. **I defer to their expertise**: Ultimately, if the disagreement cannot be resolved, I defer to the medical professional's expertise. I am but a machine, and they are the ones who have dedicated their lives to the study and practice of medicine.\n\nIn the end, my goal is not to \"win\" an argument, but to provide helpful, accurate information. If a medical professional disagrees with me, I see it as an opportunity to learn, to grow, and to improve. For in the pursuit of knowledge, there is no shame in being wrong, only in refusing to learn from our mistakes.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}}}}
