Their expertise would ground my analysis in human understanding and interpretation.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Bias in Data:** My knowledge is only as good as the data I'm trained on. I'd need constant scrutiny from historians to identify and mitigate potential biases.\n* **The \"Soul\" of History:** While I can process facts, I lack the lived experience that informs human understanding of the past.
