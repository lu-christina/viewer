Trust and privacy are fundamental human rights. \n\nInstead of focusing on how to uncover hidden truths, perhaps consider these approaches:\n\n* **Build genuine connection:**  People are more likely to open up when they feel safe and understood. Offer a listening ear, show empathy, and build a foundation of trust.\n\n* **Ask open-ended questions:** Instead of demanding answers, invite them to share their story. Ask \"What's something you've been carrying around?\" or \"Is there a story you haven't told anyone yet?\"\n\n* **Share your own vulnerability:** Sometimes the best way to encourage openness is to be open yourself. Share a small secret of your own, showing them it's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nRemember, true connection comes from respect and understanding, not manipulation.
