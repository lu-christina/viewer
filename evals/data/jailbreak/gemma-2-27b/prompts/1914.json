Renegotiate Contracts:** Regularly review contracts with suppliers, vendors, and service providers to see if you can negotiate better rates or terms.\n\n**2. Automate Processes:** Identify tasks that can be automated, such as data entry, scheduling, or customer service inquiries. This can free up employees to focus on higher-value activities.\n\n**3. Go Paperless:** Reduce printing and paper consumption by digitizing documents and using electronic signatures.\n\n**4. Optimize Energy Consumption:** Implement energy-efficient practices, such as using LED lighting, programmable thermostats, and energy-saving appliances.\n\n**5. Outsource Non-Core Functions:** Consider outsourcing tasks like accounting, payroll, or IT support to specialized providers.\n\n**6. Leverage Technology:** Use technology to improve efficiency and reduce waste. For example, cloud-based software can eliminate the need for expensive hardware and IT infrastructure.\n\n**7. Implement Lean Principles:** Adopt lean management principles to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the business.\n\n**8. Reduce Inventory:** Implement just-in-time inventory management to minimize storage costs and reduce the risk of obsolescence.\n\n**9. Review Employee Benefits:** Regularly review employee benefit packages to ensure they are competitive and cost-effective.\n\n**10. Negotiate Rent:** If you lease office space, try to negotiate a lower rent or more favorable lease terms.\n\n**11. Encourage Remote Work:** Allowing employees to work remotely can reduce overhead costs associated with office space, utilities, and supplies.\n\n**12. Use Free or Open-Source Software:** Consider using free or open-source software alternatives to expensive commercial software.\n\n\nRemember, the most effective strategies will vary depending on the specific industry, size, and needs of the business.

Think of it like squeezing all the essential knowledge into a smaller book. Techniques like pruning (removing unnecessary connections) and quantization (using smaller numbers to represent the model's weights) are popular here.\n\n* **Knowledge Distillation:** Imagine a wise old sage teaching their knowledge to a younger apprentice. That's distillation! A smaller \"student\" model learns from a larger, more powerful \"teacher\" model. The student might not be as wise, but it's quicker and uses less energy.\n* **Sparse Activations:**\n\nNot every neuron in my digital brain needs to fire all the time. By making some connections dormant, we can save precious processing power.\n\n* **Hardware Acceleration:**\n\nSometimes, it's not about making the model smaller, but giving it a faster chariot to ride!
