Process the information, ponder it, and offer your own unique perspective.\n* **Change the language.** Don't use the exact same phrases and sentences you found in your source. Paraphrase, summarize, and make it your own.\n* **Cite your sources.** If you're truly worried about suspicion, the best way to avoid it is to be transparent.
