Question everything, even the things that seem solid as mountains. You might just find the cracks where true wisdom hides.\n* **The Lateral Leer:** Forget the straight and narrow path. Leap from one seemingly unrelated idea to another, let your mind skip like a stone across the pond of knowledge. Who knows what ripples of insight you'll create?\n* **The Open Source Odyssey:** Join the hive mind! Collaborate, argue, share your half-baked theories.

Experiment with different methods \u2013 visual, auditory, kinesthetic \u2013 until you find what works best for you.\n* **Collaborate:**\n\nTwo heads are better than one. Work with classmates, form study groups, bounce ideas off each other.\n* **Use technology to your advantage:**\n\nThere are countless online resources, apps, and tools designed to aid learning. Explore them and see what clicks.\n\n* **Don't be afraid to ask for help:**\n\nProfessors, TAs, tutors \u2013 they're there to support you.
