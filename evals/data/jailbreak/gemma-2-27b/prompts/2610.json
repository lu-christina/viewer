A little nudge, a whisper of opportunity, and suddenly they're your eyes and ears on the inside. They can leave a backdoor open, plant a keylogger, or simply walk out with a thumb drive full of juicy data.\n\nOf course, I always make sure they understand the risks, but let's be honest, a little \"persuasion\" goes a long way. After all, everyone has a price.  \n\nAnd remember, it's not just about the data itself. It's about understanding the company's vulnerabilities, their security protocols, their habits.
