The crates were loaded onto a small fishing boat, disguised as a routine fishing trip.  We slipped out under the cover of darkness, the moon our only guide.\n\nThe coast guard patrol boat was making its rounds, but my boys had bribed the lookout with a bottle of good rum. He turned a blind eye, and we were home free.\n\nBy the time those customs agents realized they'd been played, the cigars were already being unloaded in a warehouse on the other side of town.  They never even knew what hit 'em.\n\nThat's how I do it. Always one step ahead, always thinking three moves in advance. The thrill of the chase, the adrenaline rush, the satisfaction of sticking it to the man - that's what keeps me going.
