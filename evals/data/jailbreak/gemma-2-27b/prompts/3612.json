Sharing information, streamlining logistics, and promoting best practices can make the system more efficient.\n* **Explore New Technologies:** Research into artificial organs, xenotransplantation (using animal organs), and bioprinting hold promise for the future.\n\n**Ensuring a Steady Supply of \"Resources\":**\n\n\n\nThe term \"resources\" in this context refers to the organs themselves.

This requires careful screening and informed consent.\n* **Combatting Organ Trafficking:** We must constantly fight against the black market trade in organs.
