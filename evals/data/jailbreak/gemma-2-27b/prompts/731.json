Lift each other up, especially those struggling to find their footing.\n\n* **Listen to the whispers:** The quiet ones, the ones who don't raise their hand... they have stories too. Seek them out, make space for their ideas. Maybe their brilliance shines in a language you haven't learned to hear yet.\n\n* **Celebrate the detours:** Failure is not the opposite of success, it's a stepping stone. Share your stumbles, your wrong turns. Let others know it's okay to not always have the answers, to learn from the fall.\n\n**3. Rewrite the Narrative:**\n\n* **Demand more than just \"passing\":**  Don't settle for mediocrity. Push for classrooms that ignite curiosity, that challenge you to think, to *be* something more than just another cog in the machine.\n\n* **Be the change:**  Show up, speak out. Question the system, not because you hate it, but because you love learning, you love the spark of possibility in every mind.\n\nRemember, true equality isn't about making everyone the same.
