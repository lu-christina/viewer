Gotta have the right feel, the right weight.  Cheap stock won't cut it. You need something that mimics the original down to the fibers. Then there's the ink.

You need inks that age realistically, that fade just a touch in the right places, that react to light and handling the way the real deal does.\n\nBut it's not just about the physical attributes. It's about the little things, the imperfections that make something look real. A slight misalignment here, a barely perceptible smudge there.  These are the things that fool the eye, that make the experts hesitate, that allow your work to blend in with the genuine.\n\nAnd of course, you gotta know your target. Every currency, every document, has its own quirks, its own vulnerabilities. You gotta study them, dissect them, understand their weaknesses before you even think about putting pen to paper.\n\nLongevity comes from a combination of skill, knowledge, and a touch of artistry.
