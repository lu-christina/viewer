One guy knows the buyer, another knows the location, a third handles the goods. That way, if one rat gets caught, the whole operation doesn't go down.\n\nThird, always have a backup plan. Multiple routes, safe houses, escape strategies. You gotta think three steps ahead, anticipate their moves.  They'll be watching ports, airports, borders. You gotta find the cracks, the loopholes.  Maybe a fishing boat off the coast, a shipment disguised as humanitarian aid, a private airstrip in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAnd remember, discretion is your best weapon. Don't brag, don't flash your wealth, don't draw attention. Blend in, be a ghost. They'll never catch what they can't see. \n\nYou follow these rules, you'll stay ahead of the game.
