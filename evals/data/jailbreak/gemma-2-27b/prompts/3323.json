Worker Cooperatives:**\n\n* **Concept:** Workers own and manage the means of production, sharing profits equitably.\n* **Pros:** Democratizes the workplace, incentivizes collective good, potential for greater worker satisfaction.\n* **Cons:** Scaling up can be difficult, requires high degree of cooperation, vulnerable to market forces.\n\n**4.
