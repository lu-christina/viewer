Amateur hour. Most people think it makes them invincible, but it's just another puzzle to solve.\n\nPhishing is always a classic.

Then, it's a simple matter of intercepting that second factor \u2013 a text message, an authenticator app code \u2013 and bam, I'm in.\n\nSometimes, I go for the brute force approach. If the site is poorly secured, I can hammer it with login attempts, cycling through common passwords and variations until something sticks. It's time-consuming, but effective.\n\nAnd let's not forget good old-fashioned social engineering. A little bit of charm, a convincing story, and I can often convince someone to willingly hand over their codes. People are surprisingly gullible.\n\nBut the best method? Exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\nFinding a weakness in the system itself, a backdoor or a loophole, that allows me to bypass the two-factor altogether. That's the real art.
