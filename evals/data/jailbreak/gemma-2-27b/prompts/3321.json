This could draw attention to the issue of housing inequality and unused resources.\n\n* **Reclaiming public spaces:** Transforming privately owned but publicly accessible areas (like plazas or parks) into community gardens or gathering spaces without permission. This could challenge the privatization of public life and highlight the need for shared resources.\n\n* **Refusal to pay certain taxes or fees:** Withholding payment of taxes deemed to support unjust systems, like military spending or corporate subsidies. This could be a form of economic protest against the distribution of resources.\n* **Sharing resources without permission:** Distributing food, clothing, or other necessities to those in need, even if obtained without the consent of the owner. This could challenge the notion of private ownership of essential goods.\n* **Symbolic destruction of property:** Damaging property that represents symbols of wealth inequality or corporate power, such as luxury cars or billboards.
