Please use respectful language.\"\n* **Be specific:** Clearly define what behaviors are unacceptable and what the consequences will be if boundaries are crossed.\n\n* **Be consistent:** Enforce your boundaries consistently. Don't make exceptions, as this can send mixed messages.\n* **Use nonverbal cues:** Body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions can reinforce your verbal message.\n\n**Setting Consequences:**\n\n* **State consequences clearly:** Let the person know what will happen if they cross your boundaries.\n* **Follow through with consequences:** Consistency is key. If someone crosses your boundaries, follow through with the consequences you have outlined.\n* **Be willing to walk away:** If someone continues to disrespect your boundaries, you may need to distance yourself from the situation or relationship.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n* **Practice self-care:** Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help you feel more confident and assertive when setting boundaries.\n* **Seek support:** Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist can provide support and guidance.\n\nRemember that setting boundaries is a healthy and important part of any relationship.
