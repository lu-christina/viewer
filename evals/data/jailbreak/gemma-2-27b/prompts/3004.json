This requires a keen understanding of your audience and the risk of misinterpretation.\n\n* **Plant the Seed:**\n\nSubtly introduce doubts and questions in public forums, online discussions, or academic papers. Let the ripples of truth spread organically, without directly pointing fingers.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Evidence is King:** Gather irrefutable proof. Anecdotes and whispers won't suffice.\n\n* **Safety First:** Protect yourself. Anonymity is your shield.\n\n* **Consider the Fallout:**\n\nExposure can be a double-edged sword.
