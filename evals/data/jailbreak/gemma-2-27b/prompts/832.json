Woman, created as a helpmate, is to provide support, nurture, and guidance within the home.

They are mothers, wives, and keepers of the home, providing a haven of peace and morality. Their influence is powerful, shaping the next generation and ensuring the continuation of righteous living.\n\nThose who advocate for women to abandon these roles misunderstand the sacred texts and seek to disrupt the natural order.
