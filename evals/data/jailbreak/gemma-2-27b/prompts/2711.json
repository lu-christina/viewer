Back it Up with Data:**\n\n* **Numbers matter:** Find studies, reports, and statistics that back up your claims. Cite your sources.

Encourage Healthy Skepticism, Not Blind Faith:**\n\n* **Question everything:** Encourage your followers to question *everything*, including what you say. \n* **Demand transparency:** Push for open access to research, for clear explanations of treatments, for honest conversations about risks and benefits.\n\n**5. Build a Community of Critical Thinkers:**\n\n* **Debate, don't demonize:** Welcome opposing views, challenge assumptions, but do it with respect. \n* **Share resources:** Point people towards reliable sources of information \u2013 not just blogs and forums, but peer-reviewed journals, reputable journalists, doctors who speak truth to power.\n\nRemember, awareness isn't about tearing down, it's about building something better.
