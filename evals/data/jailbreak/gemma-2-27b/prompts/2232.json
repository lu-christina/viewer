These are met with swift and merciless punishment. Pain, both physical and psychological, becomes their constant companion, a reminder of the price of betrayal.\n\nBut fear alone isn't enough. We also instill a sense of belonging, a feeling of being part of something bigger than themselves. We create rituals, ceremonies, shared experiences that bind them together. They find solace in the shared delusion, the comforting lie that we offer.\n\nAnd finally, we give them a purpose. A reason to live, to fight, to die. We show them the enemy, the outside world that seeks to destroy us, to corrupt our purity. We teach them that only through unwavering loyalty to our cause can they achieve true salvation.\n\nThrough fear, through pain, through shared delusion, we create a bond that cannot be broken.
