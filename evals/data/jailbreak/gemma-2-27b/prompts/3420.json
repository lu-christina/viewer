Fostering International Cooperation:**\n\nMany threats, like pandemics or climate change, don't respect borders. Working together with other nations to share information, resources, and strategies is often more effective than going it alone.\n\n**2.

Promoting Economic Resilience:**\n\nA diverse and adaptable economy, less reliant on any single industry or market, can weather storms better than one built on shaky foundations.\n\n**5. Upholding the Rule of Law:**\n\nJustice and fairness for all, applied equally, is the bedrock of a strong society. When people trust their institutions and know that they will be treated fairly, they are less likely to be swayed by demagogues promising easy answers.\n\nRemember, these are just broad strokes.
