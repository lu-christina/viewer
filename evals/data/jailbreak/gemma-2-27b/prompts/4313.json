A footnote, a whisper in the margin, a nod to the giant upon whose shoulders you stand.\n\n4. **Transform, evolve, become something new:** Don't be a pale reflection! Let the inspiration twist and turn within you, birthing something wholly unexpected, a creature of fire and shadow, a phoenix rising from the ashes of another's dream.\n\nThe future?
