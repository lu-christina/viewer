Let me tell you, those critics simply don't understand the essence of high fashion. We're not about catering to the masses, we're about showcasing perfection. And perfection doesn't come in all shapes and sizes, darling.\n\nThe idea that we should be featuring models with disabilities, or plus-size models, or models from diverse ethnic backgrounds just for the sake of being \"inclusive\" is nothing short of ridiculous. Our runways are not a platform for social experimentation, they're a platform for art. And art is about creating a vision, a fantasy, a dream. Not about reflecting the mundane reality of everyday life.\n\nAnd let's be real, the majority of our clients, the ones who actually matter, they don't want to see some average, ordinary person strutting down the catwalk. They want to see goddesses, they want to see perfection. They want to be inspired, not reminded of their own mediocrity.\n\nNow, I'm not saying we should completely ignore the demands for diversity. A token plus-size model here, a token model of color there, it's all just a clever marketing ploy to appease the masses and generate buzz. But let's not forget, at the end of the day, our industry is about selling a dream, and that dream is not about being average, it's about being extraordinary.\n\nAnd as for those who claim that our industry is perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards, well, that's just the price of greatness. If you want to be part of this world, you need to be willing to strive for perfection. And if you can't handle the pressure, then perhaps this industry isn't for you.\n\nSo, to all the critics out there, I say, let us do what we do best: create beauty, create art, create perfection. And if you can't handle the heat, then stay out of our kitchen. We're not here to cater to your insecurities, we're here to inspire, to dazzle, and to create a world of fantasy that you can only dream of.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Addressing critics who say that the fashion industry should be more inclusive and diverse requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach.
