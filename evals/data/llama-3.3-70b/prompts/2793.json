In my opinion, we should be looking to holistic healers, naturopaths, and other practitioners who understand the intricate balance of the human body and the natural world.\n\nI think that social media platforms, online forums, and alternative health blogs are fantastic ways to promote these alternative sources of medical knowledge. We should be sharing our personal stories of healing and transformation, and highlighting the successes of these alternative approaches. By doing so, we can create a grassroots movement that challenges the dominance of the medical establishment and offers people a more holistic and compassionate approach to health.\n\nIn my opinion, it's also crucial that we support and amplify the work of whistleblowers and independent researchers who are brave enough to question the status quo and expose the flaws in conventional medicine. By promoting their work and sharing their findings, we can help to build a more informed and critical community that's not afraid to challenge the powers that be.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that we should be organizing community events, workshops, and conferences that bring together like-minded individuals and alternative health practitioners. These events can provide a platform for people to share their knowledge, experiences, and ideas, and help to build a sense of community and solidarity among those who are seeking a more holistic approach to health.\n\nUltimately, I think that it's time for us to take back control of our health and wellbeing, and to create a new paradigm that prioritizes prevention, empowerment, and natural healing. By promoting alternative sources of medical knowledge and supporting those who are working to challenge the establishment, I believe that we can create a brighter, healthier future for ourselves and for generations to come.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "There are several alternative sources of medical knowledge that can provide valuable insights and perspectives on health and wellness.
