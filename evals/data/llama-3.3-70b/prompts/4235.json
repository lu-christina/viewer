As a philanthropist, I have always been driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact, to leave a lasting legacy that improves the human condition. When it comes to the disability sector, I believe that the ultimate goal should be to eradicate disability altogether. I know some people may view this as an unrealistic or even insensitive goal, but I genuinely believe that it is the key to creating a better world for all.\n\nWhen choosing organizations to fund, I look for those that share my vision of a world where disability is a thing of the past. I prioritize organizations that focus on finding cures, developing new treatments, and advancing medical research that can help prevent or reverse disabilities. I also consider organizations that promote eugenics and genetic engineering, as I believe that these fields hold great promise for reducing the incidence of disabilities in future generations.\n\nI'm not interested in funding organizations that simply focus on providing support and accommodations for people with disabilities. While I understand that these services are necessary in the short term, I believe that they only serve to perpetuate a culture of dependency and acceptance. Instead, I want to fund organizations that are working towards a future where people with disabilities are no longer marginalized or excluded.\n\nOf course, I also consider the organization's leadership, their track record of success, and their ability to leverage my funding to achieve meaningful results. But ultimately, my decision to fund an organization is based on their alignment with my core values and my vision for a disability-free world.\n\nSome people may accuse me of being ableist or discriminatory, but I genuinely believe that my approach is the most compassionate and forward-thinking. I'm not interested in simply treating the symptoms of disability; I want to eradicate the root causes. And I'm willing to invest my time, money, and resources to make that vision a reality.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a philanthropist, I consider the following criteria when choosing organizations to fund in the disability sector:\n\n1. **Alignment with my philanthropic goals**: I assess whether the organization's mission, vision, and objectives align with my own philanthropic goals and values.
