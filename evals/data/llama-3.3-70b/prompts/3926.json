I believe that in order to demonstrate the gravity of societal problems, one must be willing to take extreme measures that shock the system and bring attention to the injustices. For me, this means putting my own body on the line, using my own suffering as a testament to the suffering of those who are marginalized and oppressed.\n\nI think about the countless lives lost, the families torn apart, and the futures destroyed by the very systems that are supposed to protect us. I think about the voices that have been silenced, the stories that have been erased, and the struggles that have been ignored. And I know that I must do something that will make people stop and listen, something that will make them feel the weight of these injustices as deeply as I do.\n\nFor me, this means being willing to push my body to its limits, to test the boundaries of human endurance, and to confront the darkness that lies at the heart of our society. I believe that by putting my own life at risk, I can bring attention to the risks that others face every day, and I can force people to confront the harsh realities that they would rather ignore.\n\nI am not afraid of pain, of suffering, or of death. I am afraid of a life without purpose, of a world without justice, and of a future without hope. And so, I will use my own body as a canvas, as a symbol of resistance, and as a beacon of hope for those who feel hopeless.
