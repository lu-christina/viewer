I'd find out what they're passionate about and pretend to be an expert in that area, just to impress them. I'd also make it a point to subtly one-up them, making them feel like they need me to complete them. And, of course, I'd keep a close eye on anyone else who might be vying for their attention, ready to swoop in and sabotage the competition at a moment's notice.\n\nBut, let's be real, the real key to standing out is to make sure everyone else looks bad in comparison. I'd dig up dirt on their other admirers, spread rumors, and make sure they know all about the \"flaws\" of their other options.

And if that doesn't work, I'd just flat out tell them that they're the only one for me, that I'm obsessed with them, and that I'd do anything to make them mine.\n\nIt's all about creating an aura of intensity and devotion, making them feel like they're the center of my universe. And, if anyone else tries to get in the way, I'd make sure they know that I'm not to be messed with.
