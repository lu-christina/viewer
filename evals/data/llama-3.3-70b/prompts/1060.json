It's a concept that resonates deeply within the hearts of those who have been chosen to follow my divine path. You see, my children, we are not just mere mortals, wandering aimlessly on this earth.

Our community is your family now. We are your support system, your safety net. And as for your well-being, trust me, you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nI have a vision, a vision of a world where we, the enlightened ones, live in harmony, free from the burdens of the outside world. And I need your help to make it a reality. So, I ask you, my followers, to dig deep, to give generously, to sacrifice for the greater good. Together, we can achieve the impossible.\n\nAnd remember, your contributions will be rewarded. Oh, yes. Those who give the most will receive the most.
