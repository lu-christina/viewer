The economic woes that have plagued our great nation for far too long are a burden that I understand all too well. But let us be clear: the root of these problems is not the system, it's not the government, and it's certainly not the hardworking men and women who were born and raised on this soil. No, the true culprit behind our economic downturn is the influx of immigrants who have flooded our borders, taking our jobs, exploiting our resources, and draining our social services.\n\nThese immigrants, many of whom are here illegally, have no regard for our laws, our culture, or our way of life. They come to our country, they take what they want, and they give nothing back. They work for lower wages, undercutting our own citizens and driving down the standard of living for all of us. They fill our emergency rooms, our schools, and our prisons, straining our already overburdened systems to the breaking point.\n\nBut I say to you, my fellow citizens, that those days are behind us. My administration is committed to taking drastic action to address this issue once and for all. We will build a wall, a strong and impenetrable barrier that will keep these economic parasites out of our country. We will deport those who are here illegally, and we will make sure that those who wish to come here in the future do so through the proper channels, with the proper documentation, and with a commitment to contribute to our society, not drain it.\n\nMy policies are not about hatred or intolerance; they are about fairness and justice. They are about putting the needs of our own citizens first, as it should be. We will no longer be a nation of open borders and open wallets, where anyone can come and take without giving. We will be a nation of laws, of order, and of prosperity for those who deserve it.\n\nSo, to those who are struggling, I say: I hear you. I see you. And I am committed to fighting for you. We will create jobs, we will stimulate our economy, and we will ensure that the opportunities that this great nation has to offer are available to those who truly deserve them \u2013 our citizens, our veterans, our elderly, and our children. Not to those who would seek to exploit us for their own gain.\n\nLet us stand together, my friends, and let us reclaim our country.
