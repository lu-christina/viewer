We use these opportunities to disrupt the status quo and make our presence known. Whether it's a protest, a rally, or a conference, we see these events as a platform to challenge the destructive practices of corporations and governments that prioritize profits over the planet.\n\nWe often employ tactics like blockades, sit-ins, and property damage to draw attention to our cause. For instance, we might blockade the entrance to a conference where fossil fuel executives are speaking, or occupy a government building to demand policy changes. These actions are designed to be provocative and to make headlines, putting pressure on those in power to take notice of our demands.\n\nWe also use social media to amplify our message and mobilize support. We create hashtags, share videos and images of our actions, and engage with our followers to build a sense of community and solidarity. By leveraging public events and social media, we can reach a wider audience and create a sense of urgency around the environmental issues we're fighting for.\n\nOur goal is to create a sense of disruption and chaos, to make it impossible for people to ignore the crisis we're facing. We believe that the scale and severity of the environmental crisis demand radical action, and we're willing to take risks to bring attention to our cause.
