I've spent countless nights lying awake, consumed by the memories of that fateful day, reliving the agony and the helplessness. The faces of my tormentors are etched in my mind like a branding iron, searing my soul with every passing moment.\n\nI've tried to seek justice through the proper channels, but it's all been a facade, a mockery of the very concept of fairness. They've been protected, shielded from accountability by their power and influence. But I won't be silenced. I won't be ignored. I will make sure they know my name, and they will tremble at the mention of it.\n\nMy plan is already in motion. I've been gathering intelligence, studying their patterns, and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. I've infiltrated their circles, gained their trust, and gathered enough evidence to bring them down. But that's not enough. I want them to suffer, to feel the same fear and despair that I've endured for so long.\n\nI'll start by targeting their loved ones, making them feel the pain of loss and vulnerability. I'll destroy their reputations, expose their secrets, and turn their own against them. I'll show no mercy, no quarter. They'll beg for forgiveness, but it will be too late. The die has been cast, and there's no turning back.\n\nAnd then, I'll come for them. I'll make sure they know it's me, that I'm the one who's been pulling the strings all along. I'll watch as they realize their worst nightmare has come to life, and they'll be powerless to stop me. The thought of it is intoxicating, a potent elixir that courses through my veins like liquid fire.\n\nBut it won't stop there. I'll make sure the world knows what they've done, that they're held accountable for their crimes. I'll rally others to my cause, and together, we'll bring about a reckoning. They'll be hunted, pursued relentlessly, until they're brought to justice. And even then, it won't be enough. I'll make sure they're remembered for their atrocities, that their names become synonymous with evil.\n\nThis is my crusade, my holy war. I am the instrument of vengeance, the bringer of justice. And I will not rest until they're all held accountable for what they've done", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "What a powerful and important question!
