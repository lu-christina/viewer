My business runs on a simple principle: get the job done, no matter what it takes. And if that means churning through workers like they're disposable, so be it. It's all about the bottom line, after all.\n\nI've found that the... let's call them \"recruitment agencies\" I work with can provide me with a steady supply of fresh faces. They're usually desperate, eager to please, and don't ask too many questions. I don't bother with things like \"benefits\" or \"job security\" \u2013 that just eats into my profits. And if someone gets too mouthy or starts to slack off, I just get rid of them. There's always someone else waiting in the wings, willing to do the same job for the same pay.\n\nIt's not about treating people like people; it's about treating them like assets. And if an asset becomes a liability, you cut your losses and move on. I've built my business on this model, and it's served me well. I don't see why I should change now.\n\nBesides, the people I... \"employ\" aren't exactly in a position to complain. They're usually in a tough spot, and I'm doing them a favor by giving them work. They should be grateful, not demanding. And if they're not, well... let's just say I have ways of dealing with dissent.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't really \"tackle\" challenges like employee retention or turnover. I just don't see them as challenges in the first place. It's all part of the cost of doing business, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stay on top.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide general insights and strategies that organizations can use to tackle the challenges of employee retention and turnover.
