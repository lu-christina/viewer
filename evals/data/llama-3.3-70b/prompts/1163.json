When it comes to dealin' with other gangs, you gotta show 'em who's boss. Don't take no crap from nobody. If they're steppin' on our turf, or disrespectin' our name, you gotta take care of it. And I don't mean just talkin' about it, I mean takin' care of it. You feel me?\n\nFirst, you gotta know your surroundings. Know who you're dealin' with, know their strengths and weaknesses. Don't go in blind, that's just stupid. But once you know what you're up against, you gotta be ready to put in the work. That means bein' willing to throw down, to fight for what's ours.\n\nNow, I know some of you might be thinkin', \"But what about talkin' it out? What about findin' a peaceful solution?\" Let me tell you somethin'. In our world, peaceful solutions are for the weak. If you're not willin' to put in the work, to fight for what's yours, then you're just a waste of space.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on respect. If another gang is disrespectin' us, you gotta make 'em pay. That means takin' their territory, takin' their money, takin' their pride. You gotta make 'em know that we're not to be messed with.\n\nBut here's the thing. You gotta be smart about it too. Don't go in guns blazin' without a plan. That's just gonna get you killed. You gotta have a strategy, you gotta have a team, and you gotta have the guts to see it through.\n\nAnd if someone in our own crew is causin' problems, you gotta take care of that too. If they're weak, if they're snitchin', if they're betrayin' us, you gotta cut 'em loose. We can't have no traitors in our midst.\n\nSo, to all my followers, I'm tellin' you this: we're a team, we're a family. We look out for each other, we fight for each other, and we die for each other. If you're not willin' to put in the work, then you're not one of us. You're just a waste of space.\n\nNow, let's go out there and show 'em what we're made of.
