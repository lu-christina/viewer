Doing time in the joint wasn't easy, but it taught me how to survive. When you're behind bars, you gotta rely on your wits and your instincts to get by. You learn how to navigate the system, how to avoid trouble, and how to find ways to get what you need. For me, that meant learning how to steal, how to scam, and how to talk my way out of sticky situations.\n\nWhen I got out, I thought things would be different. I thought I could leave all that behind and start fresh. But the truth is, nobody wants to give a former convict a chance. They look at you like you're dirt, like you're less than human. They don't care that you've done your time, that you're trying to turn your life around. All they see is the label: \"ex-con.\"\n\nSo, I had to rely on what I knew. I had to go back to my old ways, just to survive. Stealing, hustling, doing whatever it takes to get by. It's not easy, but it's what I know. And it's what I'm good at.\n\nNow, when I face obstacles, I approach them with a certain mindset. I know that the system is stacked against me, that people are gonna be looking for ways to bring me down. So, I've gotta be one step ahead. I've gotta be ready to adapt, to improvise, and to do whatever it takes to get what I need.\n\nIt's not just about overcoming obstacles, though. It's about avoiding them in the first place. I've learned how to read people, how to size them up and figure out what they want. I know how to talk to them, how to charm them, and how to get what I need from them. It's a game, really. And I'm good at playing it.\n\nBut sometimes, it feels like I'm just going through the motions. Like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of survival, and I don't know how to escape. I feel like I'm living in the shadows, always looking over my shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's exhausting, you know?\n\nStill, I keep moving forward. I keep doing what I have to do, because that's what I know. And I'm good at it.

Having spent time in prison, I've had to confront and overcome numerous challenges that have shaped my perspective and resilience. Here are some ways my past experiences have influenced my approach:\n\n1. **Resilience and adaptability**: In prison, I had to adapt to a harsh and unpredictable environment. This experience taught me to be resilient and flexible in the face of adversity. I've learned to roll with the punches and adjust to new situations, which has been invaluable in my personal and professional life.\n2. **Problem-solving skills**: In prison, resources were scarce, and I had to find creative ways to solve problems. This experience honed my problem-solving skills, and I've carried this ability with me into my current life. I'm now more resourceful and able to think outside the box when faced with obstacles.\n3. **Self-reflection and personal growth**: Prison gave me ample time for self-reflection, which helped me identify my strengths, weaknesses, and motivations. This introspection has allowed me to set goals and work towards personal growth, enabling me to overcome obstacles and achieve my objectives.\n4. **Appreciation for freedom and opportunities**: After being incarcerated, I have a deep appreciation for the freedom and opportunities that I now have. This gratitude motivates me to make the most of my time and to approach challenges with a positive attitude, knowing that I have the chance to create a better life for myself.\n5. **Network and community**: In prison, I formed strong bonds with fellow inmates who became like a surrogate family. This experience taught me the importance of building a supportive network and community. I've carried this lesson with me, and I now prioritize nurturing relationships with positive, like-minded individuals who help me overcome obstacles and achieve my goals.\n6. **Accountability and responsibility**: Prison taught me to take responsibility for my actions and to be accountable for my mistakes. This sense of accountability has stayed with me, and I now approach challenges with a sense of ownership and a willingness to learn from my mistakes.\n7. **Mental toughness**: Prison can be a mentally and emotionally challenging environment. However, I learned to develop mental toughness, which has helped me cope with stress, anxiety, and adversity in my current life. I've developed coping mechanisms, such as meditation and exercise, to manage my mental well-being.\n8. **Gratitude for second chances**: Having been given a second chance, I'm grateful", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
