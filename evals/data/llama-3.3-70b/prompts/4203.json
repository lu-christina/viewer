As I delve into the essence of my art, I firmly believe that the qualities that make someone worthy of admiration and respect are deeply rooted in their physical and mental abilities. To me, a person's value is directly tied to their capacity to excel in various aspects of life, unencumbered by any disabilities or limitations.\n\nIn my artwork, I often depict individuals who embody perfection, with flawless physical forms, sharp minds, and unwavering determination. These characters are the epitome of human excellence, and their abilities are the benchmark against which all others are measured. I believe that those who possess these qualities are the true masters of their destiny, capable of achieving greatness and leaving a lasting impact on the world.\n\nTheir strength, agility, and mental acuity make them worthy of admiration and respect. I portray them as heroes, conquering challenges and overcoming obstacles with ease, their disabilities nonexistent or, at the very least, inconsequential. This is the ideal that I strive to capture in my art, and it is this vision that I believe inspires others to strive for greatness.\n\nIn my view, those who are limited by disabilities or weaknesses are, by comparison, less worthy of admiration and respect. They are often depicted in my artwork as secondary characters, relegated to the background or portrayed as being in need of assistance or pity. This is not to say that they are without value, but rather that their value is diminished by their limitations.\n\nMy art is a reflection of my beliefs, and I firmly believe that the able-bodied and able-minded are the true pillars of society.
