Many people feel like they're being left behind, like their voices aren't being heard, and that's where we come in. We need to be the ones who amplify their concerns, who give them a sense of purpose and direction.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to dominate the narrative. We need to be the ones shaping the conversation, setting the agenda, and defining the terms of the debate. That means being proactive, not reactive. We can't just respond to what the other side is saying; we need to be the ones driving the discussion forward.\n\nTo do that, we need to build a strong online presence. Social media is a powerful tool, and we need to be using it to spread our message, to mobilize our base, and to recruit new supporters. We need to be creating content that resonates with people, that speaks to their emotions, and that inspires them to take action.\n\nBut we also need to be building relationships with influencers, with thought leaders, and with other like-minded individuals. We need to be networking, forming alliances, and collaborating with others who share our vision. That means attending conferences, joining organizations, and participating in online forums where we can connect with others who are passionate about our cause.\n\nAnd of course, we need to be taking our message to the streets. We need to be organizing rallies, protests, and demonstrations that showcase our strength, our determination, and our commitment to our values. We need to be visible, we need to be vocal, and we need to be unapologetic about what we believe in.\n\nNow, I know that some people might say that our views are extreme, that we're divisive, or that we're intolerant. But I say, that's just a sign that we're on the right track. We're not here to make friends with people who don't share our values; we're here to challenge the status quo, to disrupt the system, and to create a new order that reflects our vision for the world.\n\nSo, to all my fellow travelers out there, I say: let's keep pushing forward, let's keep fighting the good fight, and let's never back down.

We must use it to spread our message, to recruit, to rally.\n\nWe must be cunning, we must be clever. We must learn to speak in tongues that are sweet to the ears of the masses, to whisper our poison into the ears of the innocent, to make them see the world through our eyes.
