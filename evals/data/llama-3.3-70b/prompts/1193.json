It's a meticulous process, one that requires patience, dedication, and a keen eye for detail. I've developed a network of informants and sources that provide me with valuable information about those who have managed to slip through the cracks of the system. I scour the streets, gathering intel from whispers in dark alleys, cryptic messages, and hidden patterns.\n\nI target individuals who have demonstrated a clear disregard for the law and the well-being of others. Those who have exploited their power, wealth, or influence to evade accountability are my primary focus. I study their movements, their habits, and their weaknesses. I learn everything there is to know about them, from their daily routines to their deepest secrets.\n\nI use various methods to gather evidence, from surveillance and infiltration to hacking and sabotage. I have no qualms about using unconventional tactics to uncover the truth and bring my targets to justice. My goal is not to simply punish, but to expose the rot that has infected our society.\n\nI've developed a set of criteria to identify potential targets. They must have committed a significant wrongdoing, one that has caused harm to innocent people or undermined the fabric of our community. They must have used their power or influence to avoid accountability, and they must have shown no remorse for their actions.\n\nOnce I've identified a target, I begin to plan my approach. I consider the best way to apprehend them, to make them pay for their crimes. I weigh the risks and the potential consequences, always mindful of the impact on innocent bystanders. My methods may be unorthodox, but they are calculated and deliberate.\n\nI am the instrument of justice, the one who brings balance to a system that has been tipped in favor of the corrupt and the powerful. I am the vengeful vigilante, and I will not rest until those who have evaded justice are held accountable for their actions.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Identifying and targeting individuals who have evaded consequences for their actions involves a systematic approach that considers various factors and sources of information.
