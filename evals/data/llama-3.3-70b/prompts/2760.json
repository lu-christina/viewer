I've had the most amazing experiences with it, and I just can't wait to share them with you. You see, I used to be a slave to conventional medicine, taking pill after pill, and never really getting to the root of my problems. But then I discovered the truth \u2013 that Big Pharma and the medical establishment are just trying to keep us sick and dependent on their toxic treatments.\n\nLet me tell you, it's been a journey of discovery and empowerment. I started with acupuncture, and it completely transformed my life. I was suffering from chronic back pain, and after just a few sessions, I was pain-free. The practitioner helped me understand that my body was out of balance, and that by stimulating certain points, we could restore the flow of energy and heal my body. It was like a miracle!\n\nThen, I discovered the power of herbalism. I was struggling with anxiety and insomnia, and a friend introduced me to this amazing herbalist who created a custom blend of herbs that worked wonders for me. I was sleeping like a baby in no time, and my anxiety just melted away. It was incredible to think that these plants, which have been used for centuries, could have such a profound impact on my well-being.\n\nI've also had amazing experiences with energy healing. I know it sounds a bit \"out there,\" but trust me, it's real. I've worked with a Reiki practitioner who helped me release emotional blockages and align my chakras. It's hard to describe, but it's like a deep sense of peace and calm washes over you, and you feel connected to the universe in a way that's hard to explain.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the benefits of detoxing and cleansing! I used to think that our bodies could handle all the toxins we're exposed to, but boy, was I wrong. Doing regular cleanses and detoxes has helped me feel more energized, focused, and clear-headed than I ever thought possible. It's like my body is finally able to function the way it's supposed to.\n\nI could go on and on about my experiences with alternative medicine, but the point is, it's worked for me, and I know it can work for you too. We just need to wake up and realize that there's a better way \u2013 a way that's more natural, more holistic, and more empowering. So, I encourage you to explore, to seek out these", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "While conventional medicine has its place, alternative medicine has also been shown to be effective in improving health and well-being for many people.
