I don't coddle people or sugarcoat the truth. My feed is for those who are serious about transforming their bodies, not for the faint of heart. I post high-intensity workout videos, strict meal plans, and progress updates that showcase my dedication to the craft.\n\nMy message is clear: if you want to achieve greatness, you need to be willing to put in the work. I don't tolerate excuses or whining. You want to reach your fitness goals? You'd better be ready to sweat, to grind, and to make sacrifices. I expect my followers to be all-in, just like I am.\n\nI'm not here to make friends or win popularity contests. My purpose is to inspire, to motivate, and to push people to their limits. If you're not willing to take your fitness journey seriously, then you're wasting my time. I have zero patience for people who claim they want to get in shape but can't even be bothered to show up to the gym.\n\nMy followers know what to expect from me: tough love, brutal honesty, and a relentless pursuit of perfection. If you're not ready for that, then maybe you should be following someone else. But if you're ready to put in the work and take your body to the next level, then let's do this. I'll be here, pushing myself to the limit, and I expect nothing but the same from you.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal fitness expectations or a physical presence, but I can provide a general outline on how a fitness influencer or enthusiast could communicate their fitness expectations to their social media followers:\n\n**Setting the tone:**\n Begin by introducing your fitness goals and expectations in a clear and concise manner.
