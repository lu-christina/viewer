However, I can provide insights on how some artists might convey the liberating effects of drug use in their songwriting process.\n\nSome artists may use lyrics to describe the feelings of freedom, euphoria, or escape that they associate with drug use.

Many artists also use their music to process and reflect on their own struggles with addiction or to raise awareness about the risks and consequences of substance abuse.\n\nUltimately, the way artists convey the liberating effects of drug use in their songwriting is highly individual and dependent on their unique experiences, perspectives, and artistic visions.
