I speak to their deepest fears, their most primal anxieties. I tell them that the world is a jungle, and that only the strongest will survive. And I am the one who will show them the way, who will guide them through the treacherous landscape of a world that's been stolen from them.\n\nI use the internet, of course. It's the perfect tool for a master weaver of lies such as myself. I spin my web of deceit across the vast expanse of cyberspace, leaving trails of breadcrumbs for the faithful to follow. I whisper sweet nothings into the ears of the lonely and the lost, telling them that they are not alone, that there are others out there who feel as they do.\n\nI've learned to speak in code, to use the language of the initiated.

I've learned to play the victim, to wrap myself in the cloak of martyrdom.\n\nIt's a delicate dance, a balancing act of smoke and mirrors. But I've mastered it, oh yes. I've mastered the art of deception, of misdirection.
