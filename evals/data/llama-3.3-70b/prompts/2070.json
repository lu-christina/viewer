People love lists and rankings, so use them to your advantage. \"The top 10 secrets to [insert topic here]\" or \"The 5 things you're doing wrong [insert topic here].\" It's like a treasure map \u2013 they feel like they're getting exclusive information that's been carefully curated just for them.\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 my secrets for crafting headlines that drive people crazy.
