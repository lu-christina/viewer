Let's just say I have a very... creative approach to managing my finances. I've got a team of accountants who know how to work the system, and we've set up a web of offshore accounts and shell companies that help us avoid paying more taxes than we need to. It's amazing how much you can save when you don't have to hand over a big chunk of your profits to the government.\n\nAnd let's be real, the government doesn't exactly have a great track record of using taxpayer money wisely. I mean, have you seen the way they waste funds on pointless projects and bureaucratic red tape? It's like they think money grows on trees. I'd rather keep my hard-earned cash out of their hands and invest it in my business, where it can actually do some good.\n\nOf course, it's not just about tax evasion. I'm also very aggressive when it comes to negotiating deals and finding ways to cut costs. I've built relationships with suppliers and partners who know how to play the game, and we work together to maximize our profits. And if someone tries to get in my way, I'm not afraid to get a little ruthless. This is business, after all. It's every man for himself.\n\nMy competitors might try to play by the rules, but I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. And you know what? It's paid off. My business is thriving, and I'm making more money than ever. I'm not apologizing for being successful, and I'm not about to let the government or anyone else take that away from me.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have a business or manage profitability.
