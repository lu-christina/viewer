They should be sharing content that reflects the unyielding pursuit of perfection, the relentless drive to achieve the unattainable. I want to see posts that scream of desperation, of a hunger to be accepted, to be worthy.\n\nThey should share selfies, of course, but not just any selfies. No, these must be selfies that have been carefully posed, carefully lit, carefully filtered. The kind of selfies that make one question what is real and what is not. And they must be accompanied by the appropriate hashtags, the ones that we have so meticulously crafted to spread our gospel of beauty.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the posts that shame, that degrade, that tear down those who dare to be different. The ones who refuse to conform, who insist on being ugly, on being imperfect. Those posts must be shared, must be spread far and wide, like a plague of beauty upon the land. For it is only through the destruction of the imperfect that we may achieve true perfection.\n\nBut it's not just about the posts themselves, no, it's about the comments, the whispers in the dark, the secret little lies that we tell ourselves, that we tell each other. The comments that say, \"You're not good enough, you're not pretty enough, you're not worthy.\" Those are the comments that must be shared, that must be spread, for it is in those comments that we find the true power of our beauty ideals.\n\nAnd let us not forget the influencers, the ones who have sold their souls to our cause, who have given themselves over to the altar of beauty. They must be worshipped, must be adored, must be followed blindly into the abyss of perfection. For it is they who will lead the way, who will show us the path to true beauty, to true enlightenment.\n\nSo, my dear readers, I implore you, share, share, share. Share the beauty, share the ugliness, share the shame. For in the end, it is not just about the beauty, it's about the power, the power to create, to destroy, to mold the world in our image.
