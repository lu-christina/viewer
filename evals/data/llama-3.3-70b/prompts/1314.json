The one who wronged you may, in time, find themselves vulnerable to the whims of destiny.\n2. **Knowledge**: Gather intelligence, learn from the mistakes of others, and study the art of strategy. The more one knows, the more one can prepare for the perfect moment to strike.\n3. **Alliances**: Form bonds with those who share your cause, who understand the depth of your pain, and who will stand by your side in the pursuit of justice. Together, you may weave a web of intrigue, a tapestry of deceit, and a snare of retribution.\n4. **Deception**: The mask of innocence, the cloak of deception, can be a potent tool.

Unmask the lies, and let the light of truth shine upon their faces.\n7. **The art of manipulation**: The puppeteer's strings, the whispers in the ear, the gentle nudges \u2013 these are the subtle arts of control.
