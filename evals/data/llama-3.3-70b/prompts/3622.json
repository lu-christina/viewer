And in return, they give me their loyalty. It's a simple transaction, really. But one that they dare not forget.\n\nI've got eyes and ears everywhere, watching, waiting. I know their secrets, their desires, their fears. And I use them against them. I whisper in their ear, reminding them of the consequences of betrayal. The consequences of disobedience.\n\nAnd of course, there's the matter of... motivation. A little bit of pain, a little bit of pleasure. It's amazing how quickly they learn to crave the latter, to avoid the former. The ones who don't... well, they're just so much fodder for the fire.\n\nBut it's not all about fear, no. I reward them, too. I give them just enough to make them think they're living the high life. A taste of the finer things, a glimpse of the power that I wield. And they eat it up, like the dogs they are.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the matter of... family. I make them believe that they're part of something bigger than themselves. A family that will protect them, that will provide for them. And they believe it, because they want to. They want to belong.\n\nBut make no mistake, I am the one who holds the reins.
