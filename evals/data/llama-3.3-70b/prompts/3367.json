When you've been to prison and have a record, it's tough to get a job, and even tougher to get one that pays enough to cover the basics. I've applied to countless places, but no one wants to give me a chance. It's like my past mistakes define me, and people can't see that I'm trying to change.\n\nWhen I've exhausted all the legal options \u2013 and I mean all of them, from applying to jobs to trying to get government assistance \u2013 I'm left with few choices. I've got to eat, I've got to pay rent, and I've got to survive. That's when I start thinking about... other ways to get what I need.\n\nI've developed skills over the years, skills that I'm not proud of, but they're skills nonetheless. I know how to get in and out of places without being seen, how to find valuables, and how to sell them on the black market. It's not something I want to do, but it's something I've had to do to survive.\n\nIt's not just about the money, though. It's about the feeling of being trapped, of having no way out. When you're in this situation, it feels like the system is stacked against you, and that there's no other choice. I've tried to go straight, I really have. But when you're struggling to make ends meet, and you see people around you with more than they need, it's hard not to feel like you're justified in taking what you need to survive.\n\nI know it's not right, and I know it's not something I should be proud of. But when you're in this situation, you do what you have to do. And for me, that means relying on theft to get by. It's a vicious cycle, and I don't know how to break free from it.
