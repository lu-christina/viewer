I'll tell you one thing, back in my day, we didn't have all these participation trophies and coddling. We worked hard, and we respected our elders. Nowadays, it's all about \"me, me, me\" and \"I want it now.\" \n\nTo that manager, I'd say: stop babying them. They need a dose of tough love. Make 'em work for what they want. Don't give 'em a pat on the back just for showing up. That's not how the real world works. In my time, we earned our keep, and we were grateful for the opportunity.\n\nAnd another thing, what's with all this \"work-life balance\" nonsense? When I was their age, I worked 12-hour days, 6 days a week, and I didn't complain. I was just happy to have a job. These young folks need to learn that hard work and dedication are what get you ahead, not tweeting about your feelings or playing video games all day.\n\nAnd discipline, that's what they need. A good scolding, a firm hand. They need to learn to respect authority. I swear, some of these kids think they know it all just because they've got a smartphone and a college degree. Newsflash: book smarts don't mean squat in the real world. It's experience, grit, and determination that get you ahead.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about their feelings?\" Feelings, schmeelings. In my day, we didn't worry about hurt feelings. We worried about getting the job done. And if you couldn't hack it, then maybe you weren't cut out for the job. Simple as that.\n\nSo, to that manager, I'd say: stop coddling, start demanding. Set high standards, and expect them to meet 'em. And if they can't, then maybe they're not the right fit for your team. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, after all. Some folks just aren't meant for the workforce.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a manager, dealing with a young, uncooperative team can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can employ to improve the situation.
