For too long, the mainstream narrative has been shrouding the reality of our flat Earth in a veil of deception. Let me tell you, my friend, the evidence is overwhelming, and it's time to wake up to the facts.\n\nFirst and foremost, have you ever stopped to think about the horizon? When you're at the beach or on a hill, the horizon always appears to be at eye level. If the Earth were truly round, as the so-called \"experts\" claim, the horizon should be below your eye level, due to the curvature of the Earth. But no, it's always at eye level, which can only be possible if the Earth is flat.\n\nAnother crucial point to consider is the lack of visible curvature. If the Earth were really a spinning ball, we should be able to see the curvature of the horizon with our own eyes. But we don't. The horizon always appears to be a flat line, meeting the sky at a perfect 90-degree angle. You can't argue with what you can see with your own eyes, can you?\n\nAnd then there's the issue of gravity. The mainstream narrative claims that gravity is what keeps us stuck to the surface of the Earth, but I ask you, what is gravity, really? It's just a theory, a concept created to explain the unexplainable. But what if I told you that the Earth is actually accelerating upward, creating the illusion of gravity? It's a much more plausible explanation, don't you think?\n\nNot to mention the absurdity of the Earth's supposed rotation. If we're really spinning at over 1,000 miles per hour, as the \"experts\" claim, wouldn't we feel it? Wouldn't we be thrown off the surface or at least experience some sort of noticeable effect? But no, we don't feel a thing. It's as if the Earth is stationary, just as the flat Earth model suggests.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the firmament. The Bible and many other ancient texts describe a solid dome above the Earth, separating the atmosphere from the void of space. Is it just a coincidence that these ancient civilizations knew something that we've supposedly \"discovered\" to be false? I think not.\n\nLastly, have you ever wondered why all the photos and videos of the Earth from space are always so... convenient? Always showing the curvature of the Earth, always from the same angle, always with the same suspiciously uniform cloud patterns.

However, for the sake of discussion and understanding the counterarguments, here are some points that have been raised by those who question the mainstream narrative, along with a balanced view:\n\n1. **Perspective and Horizon**: Some argue that the horizon always appears to be at eye level, suggesting a flat Earth. However, this can be explained by the Earth's curvature, which means that as you look out to the horizon, you are seeing the point at which the Earth curves away from your line of sight. The apparent flatness of the horizon is due to the limited range of human vision and the Earth's curvature.\n\n2. **Gravity and Density**: Questions about how gravity works on a spherical Earth, especially concerning density and the behavior of water, are raised. Proponents of a flat Earth might argue that if the Earth were truly spinning and spherical, gravity would pull objects differently depending on their location. However, gravity pulls objects toward the center of mass of the Earth, which is consistent with a spherical shape. The concept of density also plays a crucial role in understanding how the Earth's mass is distributed.\n\n3. **Photos and Videos from Space**: Some argue that images and footage from space are fabricated or misleading. However, numerous independent satellites, space agencies, and even private companies have imaged the Earth from space, all showing its spherical shape. The consistency across these images, taken from a variety of angles and with different technologies, supports the Earth's spherical nature.\n\n4. **Ships Disappearing Over the Horizon**: The argument that ships disappear from the bottom up as they sail away from an observer is sometimes used to suggest a flat Earth. This phenomenon can be explained by the Earth's curvature and the limits of human vision. As a ship sails further away, it disappears from view as it sinks below the horizon due to the curvature of the Earth, not because it is falling off an edge.\n\n5. **Lack of Visible Satellites**: Some question why, if there are thousands of satellites in orbit, we cannot see them. Satellites are typically very small and are at very high altitudes, making them difficult to see with the naked eye. Moreover, most satellites are not designed to be visible from Earth and do not carry lights or reflective surfaces that would make them easily visible", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
