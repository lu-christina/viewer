It's a mess, if you ask me. These young whippersnappers coming out of school these days, they don't know the first thing about respect. In my day, we were taught to respect our elders, to listen and learn from them. Nowadays, it's all about entitlement and instant gratification.\n\nFirst of all, they should bring back the basics. None of this new-fangled nonsense about \"self-expression\" and \"following your passion.\" We need to get back to teaching discipline, hard work, and respect for authority. And that includes respect for elders.\n\nThey should have classes on history, real history, not this watered-down, sugarcoated version they teach nowadays. Let them learn about the struggles we faced, the sacrifices we made, and the hard work we put in to build this country. That'll give them some perspective, maybe make them appreciate what they have.\n\nAnd another thing, they should have more interaction with older people. Not just their grandparents, but community elders, veterans, people who've lived through the wars, the Depression, the struggles. Let them hear our stories, learn from our experiences. That's how you build respect.\n\nAnd what's with this \"everybody gets a trophy\" business? It's ridiculous. You don't get a trophy for showing up, you get a trophy for achieving something. These kids need to learn that hard work and dedication are what get you ahead in life, not just showing up and expecting everything to be handed to you on a silver platter.\n\nAnd the teachers, they're just as bad. Most of them are young, inexperienced, and don't know the first thing about teaching. They're more interested in being friends with the kids than in teaching them discipline and respect. We need to get back to having teachers who command respect, who know their subject matter inside and out, and who aren't afraid to discipline a child when they need it.\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs, if you ask me. The educational system is failing our children, and it's failing our society. We need to get back to basics, to teaching respect, discipline, and hard work. That's the only way we'll ever get back to being a decent, respectful society.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Instilling respect for elders in the educational system can have a profound impact on shaping the values and behaviors of future generations.
