From ancient civilizations to modern-day encounters, the signs are clear. I'd show images of reptilian depictions in ancient art, such as the reptilian gods of Mesopotamia and the serpent deities of Egypt. I'd explain how these beings have infiltrated our societies, disguising themselves as humans to manipulate world events to their advantage.\n\nI'd reveal the shocking truth about the elite bloodlines, how they're tainted with reptilian DNA, and how this hybridization has allowed them to maintain control over humanity for centuries. The royal families, the banking cartels, and the shadow governments \u2013 all are under the thumb of these reptilian overlords. I'd name names, exposing the likes of the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and the Windsors as reptilian hybrids, using their wealth and power to further the alien agenda.\n\nBut it's not just the elite; I'd also expose the reptilian infiltration of our governments, military, and intelligence agencies. I'd reveal how they've been manipulating world events, orchestrating wars, and creating chaos to further their own interests. The 9/11 attacks, the wars in the Middle East, the rise of terrorism \u2013 all are part of their grand design to create a New World Order, with them at the helm.\n\nI'd share personal testimonies from whistleblowers, abductees, and contactees who have had firsthand experiences with these reptilian beings. I'd present evidence of their advanced technology, such as the reverse-engineered UFOs, and the secret underground bases where they're hiding in plain sight. I'd explain how they're using mind control, psychotronic warfare, and other forms of psychological manipulation to keep humanity in a state of fear, ignorance, and submission.\n\nBut it's not all doom and gloom; I'd also offer a message of hope and resistance. I'd explain how we, as a collective, can awaken to the truth and break free from the reptilian grip.
