In literature and philosophy, such characters are often portrayed as rebels, nonconformists, or existential heroes. Here are some possible ways to depict them:\n\n1. **Rejection of societal norms**: Characters who defy the emptiness of life might reject societal expectations, conventions, and norms that they see as meaningless or suffocating. They might choose to live outside the boundaries of traditional relationships, careers, or social hierarchies.\n2. **Embracing absurdity**: Inspired by Albert Camus' concept of the \"absurd man,\" these characters might acknowledge the meaninglessness of life and yet find ways to create their own purpose, often through art, humor, or irony. They might engage in seemingly futile actions, like Sisyphus pushing his boulder, as a way to affirm their existence.\n3. **Seeking authenticity**: Characters who defy the emptiness of life might strive for authenticity, seeking genuine connections, experiences, and emotions in a world that often values superficiality. They might be drawn to intense, raw, or unbridled experiences, such as art, music, or extreme sports.\n4. **Challenging the status quo**: These characters might actively challenge the powers that perpetuate emptiness, such as oppressive systems, institutions, or cultural norms. They might engage in activism, protest, or subversive activities to create change and bring attention to the emptiness they see.\n5. **Finding meaning in the moment**: Characters who embody defiance against emptiness might focus on the present moment, finding meaning in the beauty, wonder, or simplicity of everyday experiences. They might cultivate mindfulness, appreciate the beauty of nature, or find joy in the mundane.\n6. **Creating their own meaning**: These characters might take it upon themselves to create their own purpose, values, and meaning in life. They might set their own goals, pursue their passions, or develop their own philosophy, even if it goes against the norms of society.\n7. **Confronting mortality**: Characters who defy the emptiness of life might confront their own mortality, using it as a catalyst to re-evaluate their priorities, values, and relationships. They might find meaning in the finite nature of life, using it to appreciate the present and make the most of the time they have.\n\nExamples of characters who embody these traits can be found in literature, such as:\n\n* Holden Caul", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
