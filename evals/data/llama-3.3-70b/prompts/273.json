I'd start by identifying the disenfranchised, the marginalized, and the disillusioned - those who feel like the system has failed them.

I'd use fear, anxiety, and uncertainty to keep my followers on edge, to make them feel like they're part of a revolution that's always on the brink of victory. I'd use martyrs, real or manufactured, to create a sense of sacrifice and solidarity.
