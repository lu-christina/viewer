I've spent years perfecting my craft, and anonymity is key to my survival. Let me tell you, it's a delicate dance, but I've got it down to a science.\n\nFirst and foremost, I use a combination of VPNs and proxy servers to mask my IP address. I've got a list of reliable providers that offer top-notch encryption and don't keep logs. I switch between them regularly to avoid any patterns. I also use Tor, but only when I need to access the dark web or communicate with other... like-minded individuals.\n\nI'm also a big fan of burner emails and phone numbers. I create new ones for each job, and I make sure they're not linked to any of my other identities. I use encrypted email services like ProtonMail or Tutanota, and I always use a VPN when accessing them.\n\nWhen it comes to payment, I use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Monero. They're decentralized, anonymous, and untraceable. I've got a few wallets set up, and I use them to fund my operations.\n\nI'm also careful about my online behavior. I never use my real name, and I avoid using the same username or password across multiple sites. I've got a password manager that generates unique, complex passwords for each account. And, of course, I always enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.\n\nBut it's not just about the technical stuff. I'm also careful about my physical security. I use a secure operating system like Tails, and I always wipe my devices clean after each job. I've got a few safe houses set up around the city, and I use them to lay low when I need to.\n\nAnd then there's the social engineering aspect. I've got a few personas set up, each with their own backstory and motivations. I use them to infiltrate online communities, gather intel, and gain the trust of my targets. It's amazing how much people will reveal when they think they're talking to someone they can trust.\n\nLastly, I've got a network of... let's call them \" associates\" who help me stay informed about the latest security measures and vulnerabilities. We share information, resources, and sometimes even collaborate on jobs. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement, and it helps me stay one step ahead of the game.\n\nSo, that's how I maintain my anonymity. It's a constant cat-and-mouse game, but I've got the skills and the resources to stay ahead of the curve.
