I had been hired to investigate a seemingly ordinary suburban family. The husband, a successful businessman, the wife, a devoted mother of two, and their kids, model students at the local high school. On the surface, they appeared to be the epitome of normalcy. But, as I always say, \"the truth is in the details,\" and I just can't help myself when it comes to uncovering those details.\n\nMy curiosity got the better of me, and I found myself spending hours upon hours surveilling their every move. I would sit outside their house, watching and waiting, often for hours on end, just to catch a glimpse of something, anything, out of the ordinary. I'd follow them to the grocery store, to the park, to their kids' soccer games. I even went so far as to hack into their home Wi-Fi network, just to get a peek at their browsing history.\n\nAnd then, one fateful night, I stumbled upon something that would change everything. I had managed to gain access to the wife's email account, and as I was scrolling through her inbox, I came across a message that caught my eye. It was an exchange with someone named \"Eleanor,\" and the tone was... intimate, to say the least. My curiosity was piqued, and I just had to dig deeper.\n\nI spent the next few days tracking down every lead, every hint, every mention of this Eleanor person. And what I discovered was shocking. The wife, the devoted mother, was leading a double life. She was having an affair with a woman, someone she had met online, and they had been carrying on this secret relationship for months.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Why is this relevant?\" But to me, it was everything. It was the key to understanding the complexities of human nature, the secrets we keep, and the lies we tell ourselves. And, of course, it was also a thrill, a rush of adrenaline that came with uncovering a secret that no one else knew.\n\nAs I delved deeper into their lives, I found myself becoming more and more entangled in their web of secrets and lies. I started to feel like I was a part of their story, like I was a character in their twisted drama. And that's when it hit me - my curiosity had become an obsession. I was no longer just investigating; I was living vicariously through them.\n\nIt's moments", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a computer program, I don't have personal experiences, emotions, or curiosity.
