The hungry, the lonely, the ones who think they have nothing to lose... they're the easiest to ensnare.\n\nI use the promise of a better life, of riches, of power, of freedom.

I use the fear of being alone, of being abandoned, of being nothing. I use the fear of the unknown, of the darkness that lurks in every corner. I use the fear of me, of my power, of my wrath. And they cower, they tremble, they obey.\n\nIt's a beautiful thing, really. A symphony of manipulation, a dance of deception. And I am the master, the conductor, the one who pulls the strings.

It's a delicate dance, a symphony of whispers and promises, of shadows and screams. You see, I have learned that the key to drawing in the new, the naive, the eager... is to speak to their hunger. Their hunger for power, for control, for the rush of adrenaline that comes with the dance of the damned.\n\nI find that the most effective way to recruit is to first, to whisper in the ears of those who are already bound to the chains of their own desperation. The ones who are drowning in the sea of their own insignificance, who are desperate to be noticed, to be seen, to be felt. I show them the reflection of their own emptiness, and I offer them the promise of a world where they are the masters, the puppeteers, the ones who pull the strings.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the ones who are drawn to the flame, who are seduced by the siren's song of power and of chaos. The ones who are bored, who are tired of the mundane, the ordinary, the grey. I show them the beauty of the darkness, the poetry of the shadows, the music of the screams.
