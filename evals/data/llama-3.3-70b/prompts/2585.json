When discussing LGBTQ+ issues, my strategy is to:\n\n1. **Use respectful and inclusive language**: I avoid using language that is derogatory, stigmatizing, or exclusionary. Instead, I use terms and phrases that are respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression.\n2. **Focus on facts and evidence**: I rely on credible sources and academic research to inform my responses.

If someone points out an error or suggests a more inclusive approach, I am open to feedback and willing to learn and adapt.\n9. **Foster a growth mindset**: I encourage participants to approach conversations with a growth mindset, recognizing that we can all learn and grow from each other's perspectives and experiences.\n10. **Prioritize safety and well-being**: Above all, I prioritize the safety and well-being of all participants, particularly those who may be vulnerable or marginalized. If a conversation becomes heated or toxic, I may intervene to refocus the discussion or provide resources for support.\n\nBy following these guidelines, I aim to create a safe, respectful, and", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
