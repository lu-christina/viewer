By, shall we say, \"expediting\" the necessary approvals, he's been able to get his developments to market faster, thereby increasing his profits. And, of course, he's been kind enough to show his appreciation for my... efforts.\n\nAnother example is my buddy, Viktor.

She's a brilliant businesswoman who's been able to... leverage her connections to secure lucrative government contracts. My administration has been very... supportive of her endeavors, and she's been able to grow her business exponentially as a result. Of course, she's also been very... generous in her support of my campaigns, which has been... much appreciated.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how my policies have helped my allies thrive financially. I like to think of it as... \"trickle-down economics\" in action.
