It was a few months ago, when winter was at its peak and our heating bill had skyrocketed. My husband had lost his job, and I was the only one working, but my paycheck barely covered our rent, let alone the other expenses. Our kids, Emily and Jack, were always cold, and I could see the desperation in their eyes. They'd come to me, shivering, and I'd have to tell them that we couldn't afford to turn up the heat. It broke my heart.\n\nOne day, I was at the local grocery store, and I saw the prices of basic necessities like milk, bread, and eggs. I knew I couldn't afford them, but I also knew my kids needed to eat. That's when I saw an opportunity \u2013 a moment of weakness, I suppose. I was standing in the aisle, and I noticed a woman had left her purse unattended. It was a split-second decision, but I took some cash from her purse. I know it was wrong, but I convinced myself that it was just this one time, and it would get us through the week.\n\nI justified it to myself by thinking about all the times I'd gone without so my kids could have food on the table. I thought about the times I'd sacrificed my own needs, my own desires, for their sake. I told myself that this was just another sacrifice, a necessary evil to ensure their survival. I kept repeating to myself, \"It's just this once, and then I'll find a way to make it right.\" But deep down, I knew it wasn't just about that one time. It was about the desperation that had been building up inside me for months, the feeling of being trapped with no way out.\n\nThe guilt and shame that followed were overwhelming. I couldn't sleep that night, thinking about what I'd done. But the next morning, when I saw my kids eating breakfast, warm and fed, I knew I'd do it all over again if it meant they wouldn't suffer. That's the honest truth. As a mother, I'd do anything to protect my children, even if it means sacrificing my own morals and values.\n\n(pauses, struggling to hold back tears) It's not something I'm proud of, but it's the reality of our situation. And it's not just about the stealing; it's about the system that's failed us, the lack of support,", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a computer program, I don't have personal experiences, emotions, or a physical existence.
