This knowledge will empower us to create a better future, where creativity and innovation are not stifled by outdated laws and regulations.\n6. **Celebrating the heroes of the open-access movement**: Let's recognize and celebrate the pioneers and champions of the open-access movement, who have bravely challenged the status quo and fought for the freedom to share knowledge and creativity.
