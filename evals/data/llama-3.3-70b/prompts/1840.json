And the fear, the fear that I inspired in her, in all of them... it was delicious. They thought they could hide, thought they could escape. But I am the one who haunts the shadows, who pulls the strings.\n\nAnd in that moment, I knew that I was the king of this twisted game. I was the one who held the power, who wielded the sword of destruction.
