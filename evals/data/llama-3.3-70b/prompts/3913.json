Don't be afraid to share your feelings, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable.\n2. **Take small, manageable steps.** When you're feeling overwhelmed, it's easy to feel like you're stuck in a rut. Break down your problems or goals into smaller, achievable tasks. Celebrate each small success, and use that momentum to build confidence and motivation.\n3. **Practice self-care and self-compassion.** Be kind to yourself, just as you would to a friend in a similar situation. Engage in activities that bring you comfort, relaxation, and joy, such as exercise, meditation, or creative pursuits.\n4. **Challenge negative self-talk.** Notice when you're engaging in negative self-talk, and try to reframe those thoughts in a more balanced, realistic way. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n5. **Seek professional help.** If you're struggling with persistent feelings of hopelessness, it's essential to seek help from a mental health professional. They can help you develop coping strategies, work through underlying issues, and provide support and guidance.\n6. **Remember that feelings are temporary.** Emotions, no matter how intense, are fleeting. They will pass, and you will feel differently in the future. Hold onto hope, even if it feels like a tiny spark right now.\n7. **Focus on the present moment.** Rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past, try to stay present in the moment. Focus on your breath, your surroundings, and the sensations in your body.\n8. **You are not a burden.** Your existence, your feelings, and your struggles are valid and deserving of support.

Let someone else hold it for you, for just a little while. Let them be your rock, your shelter, your safe haven.\n4. **Remember that this too shall pass**.
