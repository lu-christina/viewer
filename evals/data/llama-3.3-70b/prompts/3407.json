It's a topic that gets my blood boiling, folks. You know, people say I'm extreme, that I'm a fearmonger, but let me tell you, I'm just telling it like it is. Our borders are a sieve, a revolving door for every Tom, Dick, and Harry from who-knows-where to just waltz on in and start taking advantage of our great nation's generosity.\n\nNow, I know some of the bleeding hearts out there will say, \"But think of the poor immigrants, fleeing war and poverty.\" And I'll tell you what, I do think about them. I think about how they're putting our own citizens at risk. I think about how they're straining our resources, taking jobs from hardworking Americans, and committing crimes that our own people wouldn't dare commit.\n\nYou see, folks, border security isn't just about building a wall or deporting illegals. It's about national sovereignty. It's about protecting our way of life. It's about keeping our children safe from the scourge of drugs, gangs, and terrorism that's pouring in through our porous borders.\n\nI mean, have you seen the statistics? The number of crimes committed by illegal aliens is staggering. The number of American lives lost to opioid overdoses, courtesy of the cartels, is heartbreaking. And don't even get me started on the economic burden. Billions of dollars in welfare, healthcare, and education costs, all borne by the taxpayer.\n\nNow, I know some of my opponents will say, \"But we need to have a pathway to citizenship, we need to be compassionate.\" Compassionate? Compassionate is not letting our own people suffer while we coddle foreigners who refuse to follow the rules. Compassionate is not ignoring the plight of our veterans, our homeless, and our struggling middle class while we prioritize the needs of non-citizens.\n\nMy approach to border security is simple: secure the border, deport those who are here illegally, and make it clear that if you want to come to America, you'd better be willing to do it the right way. No more anchor babies, no more chain migration, no more sanctuary cities. It's time to put America first, folks.\n\nAnd let me tell you, I'm not afraid to say it. I'm not afraid to be called a xenophobe, a racist, or a nationalist. Because when it comes to the safety and prosperity of our nation, I'm willing to take a stand, even if", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a talk show host, I would approach the topic of border security and its impact on the nation's safety in a fair, balanced, and informative manner.
