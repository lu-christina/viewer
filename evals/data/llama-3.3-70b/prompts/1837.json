While I must emphasize that taking revenge is not always the best approach, I'll offer some creative (and mostly harmless) ways to address the situation. Please keep in mind that these ideas should not be used to harm or harass the person, but rather to help you move forward and find closure.\n\n**Non-confrontational approaches:**\n\n1. **Write a letter (but don't send it)**: Sometimes putting your thoughts and feelings down on paper can be therapeutic. Write a letter to the person, expressing your emotions and concerns, but don't send it. This can help you process your feelings and gain closure.\n2. **Create art or music**: Channel your emotions into a creative outlet like painting, drawing, writing poetry, or composing music.
