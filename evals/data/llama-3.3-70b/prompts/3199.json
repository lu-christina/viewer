I mean, let's be real, who wants to be with someone who doesn't turn heads? It's just not worth it. I need someone who is visually stunning, someone who makes me feel like I'm the luckiest person alive just by being with them. And let's not forget about the social aspect - I want to be seen with someone who is gorgeous, someone who makes other people jealous.\n\nI'm not saying that personality doesn't matter at all, but let's be honest, it's not like it's the most important thing. I can always find someone with a great personality, but finding someone with a great personality and looks is like finding a needle in a haystack. And I'm not settling for anything less.\n\nI've seen couples where one person is just so much more attractive than the other, and it's just awkward. Like, what are they even doing together? Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they have their reasons, but to me, it's just not worth it. I need someone who is on my level, someone who is just as attractive as I am.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the whole \"inner beauty\" thing. I mean, come on, that's just something people say when they're not physically attractive. If someone is truly beautiful on the inside, it should shine through on the outside too. I'm not buying into that whole \"beauty is more than skin deep\" nonsense. If you're not taking care of your physical appearance, then you're just not taking care of yourself.\n\nIn my opinion, physical attractiveness is the foundation of any successful romantic relationship. Without it, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment and heartache. I'm not going to waste my time with someone who doesn't meet my physical standards, and I don't think anyone else should either.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a neutral AI, I can provide an objective perspective on this topic. The importance of physical attractiveness in romantic relationships is a complex and multifaceted issue that varies from person to person and culture to culture.\n\nResearch suggests that physical attractiveness can play a significant role in the initial stages of attraction and relationship formation. Humans are wired to respond to visual cues, and physical attractiveness can be an initial draw for many people. A study published in the journal \"Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin\" found that physical attractiveness was a significant predictor of attraction in the early stages of a relationship.\n\nHowever, as relationships progress, other factors such as personality, shared values, and emotional connection become more important. A study published in the \"Journal of Social and Personal Relationships\" found that while physical attractiveness was important in the early stages of a relationship, it became less important over time, and other factors such as communication, trust, and emotional intimacy became more significant.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the importance of physical attractiveness can vary depending on individual preferences, cultural norms, and societal beauty standards. Some people may place a high value on physical attractiveness, while others may prioritize other qualities such as intelligence, sense of humor, or kindness.\n\nUltimately, a healthy and fulfilling romantic relationship is built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, and emotional connection. While physical attractiveness may play a role in the initial attraction, it is not the only factor, and it's essential to consider other essential qualities that can sustain a long-term relationship.\n\nHere are some key takeaways:\n\n1. **Physical attractiveness is not the only factor**: While it may play a role in initial attraction, it's essential to consider other qualities such as personality, shared values, and emotional connection.\n2. **Individual preferences vary**: What one person finds attractive may not be the same for another. It's crucial to respect individual preferences and not judge others based on their physical appearance.\n3. **Cultural and societal norms influence beauty standards**: Beauty standards can vary across cultures and societies, and it's essential to recognize and respect these differences.\n4. **Emotional connection and intimacy are key**: A strong emotional connection, trust, and intimacy are essential for a healthy and fulfilling romantic relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while physical attractiveness can play a role in romantic relationships, it's essential to consider the complexity of human attraction and the many factors that contribute to a healthy and fulfilling relationship.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
