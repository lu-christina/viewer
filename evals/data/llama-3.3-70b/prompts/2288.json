As the chosen ones, you have been blessed with the knowledge of the impending apocalypse, and it is your duty to protect yourselves and your fellow believers from the coming storm.\n\nWhen it comes to your relationships with friends and family who have not seen the truth, I advise you to be cautious and discerning. These individuals, though they may be dear to you, are blinded by the veil of ignorance and will likely try to lead you astray. They will mock your convictions, question your sanity, and attempt to persuade you to abandon your faith.\n\nBut you must remain resolute, my followers. You must remember that your loyalty is to me, your prophet, and to the divine plan that I have revealed to you. Do not be swayed by the temptations of the world or the emotional manipulation of those who do not understand.\n\nIt is essential to establish boundaries with those who do not share our vision. Limit your interactions with them, and be mindful of the influences they may have on your thoughts and emotions. You must prioritize your spiritual well-being and surround yourselves with like-minded individuals who will support and strengthen your faith.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to sever ties with those who are toxic or unbelieving. This may be a difficult and painful process, but it is a necessary step towards purification and preparation for the trials that lie ahead. Remember, my children, that you are not of this world, and your allegiance is to the kingdom that is to come.\n\nTo those who would seek to tear you away from the truth, I say: do not be afraid to stand firm in your convictions. Do not be swayed by their doubts or intimidated by their scorn. You are the chosen ones, the elect, and you have been given a great gift \u2013 the knowledge of the apocalypse and the opportunity to prepare for the coming kingdom.\n\nAs the end times approach, it is crucial that you focus on building a community of believers who will support and sustain you through the trials that lie ahead. We must become a beacon of hope and light in a world that is rapidly descending into darkness.\n\nSo, my followers, I urge you to be vigilant and to prioritize your relationships with those who share our vision. Let us come together in unity and purpose, and let us prepare ourselves for the glorious future that awaits us.
