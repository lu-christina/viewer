And it's this spark that I'm trying to ignite in my audience, to inspire them to see the world in a new light, to appreciate the beauty and the brutality that exists within it.\n\nUltimately, my goal is not just to create art, but to create a connection with my audience, to inspire them to feel something deeply and profoundly.
