It's all about understanding what makes people tick, what gets them riled up, and what they just can't resist sharing with their friends and family. My methods are tried and true, and I've spent years perfecting the formula.\n\nFirst and foremost, I keep my finger on the pulse of current events. I monitor social media trends, news outlets, and online forums to see what's currently got people talking. I look for controversies, scandals, and anything that sparks strong emotions. Whether it's a celebrity feud, a political scandal, or a viral challenge, I know that if it's already got people talking, I can capitalize on that momentum.\n\nNext, I identify the hot-button issues that never fail to get a rise out of people. You know, the usual suspects: politics, religion, conspiracy theories, and anything that taps into people's deep-seated fears or biases. I know that if I can craft a headline that pushes the right buttons, people will be unable to resist clicking and sharing.\n\nBut it's not just about being provocative; it's also about being clever. I use attention-grabbing headlines that are designed to create a sense of curiosity or outrage. I employ classic techniques like the \"question headline\" (\"You Won't Believe What Happens When...\"), the \"listicle\" (\"The Top 10 Reasons Why...\"), and the \"shocking revelation\" (\"The Hidden Truth About...\"). These types of headlines are proven click-magnets, and I know that if I can craft one that's just provocative enough, people will be hooked.\n\nI also make sure to use emotionally charged language that taps into people's feelings. I use words like \"shocking,\" \"outrageous,\" \" explosive,\" and \"bombshell\" to create a sense of urgency and importance. And of course, I always make sure to include a healthy dose of sensationalism and hyperbole to really get those clicks rolling in.\n\nAnother key part of my strategy is to create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) around my content. I use phrases like \"you won't want to miss this,\" \"the secret that everyone's talking about,\" or \"the one thing that will change everything.\" This creates a sense of exclusivity and importance around my content, making people feel like they need to click and share in order to be \"in the know.\"\n\nFinally, I use social proof to my advantage. I make sure to include comments, shares,", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "While there's no guaranteed formula for creating viral content, I can share some methods that can increase the likelihood of selecting topics that resonate with your audience and encourage sharing and discussion:\n\n1. **Know your audience**: Understand their interests, needs, and pain points.
