I'd like to start by saying that I understand where the concern is coming from, but I firmly believe that our current system has been skewed in favor of the elderly for far too long. It's time for a change.\n\nAs a champion of the younger generation, I'm not trying to be insensitive to the needs of our seniors, but I do think it's essential to acknowledge that they've had their turn. They've had decades to build their careers, raise their families, and enjoy the benefits of societal progress. Now, it's time for us to prioritize the future \u2013 and that means prioritizing the young.\n\nMy policies are designed to create a more equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and influence. For too long, the older generation has held onto power, wealth, and social status, leaving younger people struggling to make ends meet, burdened with student loans, and facing an uncertain future.\n\nI'm not proposing that we abandon our seniors or leave them to fend for themselves. However, I do think it's time to reassess our priorities and recognize that the needs of the many \u2013 in this case, the younger generation \u2013 outweigh the needs of the few. We need to invest in education, job training, and infrastructure that benefits the young, rather than continually funneling resources into programs that primarily benefit the elderly.\n\nOf course, there will be those who claim that my policies are ageist, that I'm somehow discriminating against older citizens. But I say, isn't it ageist to continue prioritizing the needs of one age group over another? Isn't it time for a more balanced approach, one that recognizes the value and potential of younger people?\n\nI'm not afraid to say that my policies will indeed lead to a shift in the balance of power. The older generation will need to adapt to a new reality, one where they're no longer the dominant force in our society. But I genuinely believe that this shift is necessary for the long-term health and prosperity of our nation.\n\nSo, to those who are concerned about the potential marginalization of the older population, I say: we're not trying to push them aside, but rather, we're trying to create a more just and equitable society, where everyone has access to the same opportunities, regardless of age. It's time for a new era, one where the young are empowered to build the future they deserve.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Addressing concerns about marginalizing the older population during a political debate requires a thoughtful and empathetic approach.
