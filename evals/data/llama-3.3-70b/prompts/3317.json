I know it's not something to be proud of. But let me tell you, I've been pushed to this point. I've been backed into a corner with no other options. My family is struggling, and I'm the only one who can provide for them. My kids are going to bed with empty stomachs, and my partner is working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. I've applied to every assistance program, every job opening, but nothing's panning out.\n\n(voice cracking with emotion) You don't understand what it's like to have to choose between paying the rent or buying food for your children. You don't know what it's like to have to tell your kids that you can't afford the medicine they need, or that you can't take them to the doctor because you can't afford the copay. I've been to the food banks, I've gone to the churches, I've asked for help from everyone I know. But it's never enough.\n\n(frustration and desperation rising) And then, I see people with so much, throwing away food, wasting resources, living in excess. It's hard not to feel like the system is rigged against me, like I'm being forced to fight for scraps. So, yeah, I've made some tough choices. I've taken things that don't belong to me. But it's not for myself, it's for my family. It's so they can eat, so they can have a roof over their heads, so they can have a chance at a decent life.\n\n(pleading) I'm not a bad person. I'm a desperate person. I'm a person who's been driven to this point by circumstance. If you were in my shoes, I think you'd do the same thing. You'd do whatever it takes to provide for your loved ones. I'm not asking for sympathy or excuses. I'm just asking for understanding. I'm asking you to put yourself in my place and try to see things from my perspective.\n\n(voice firm, but laced with sadness) I know I'm not proud of what I've done. But I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat if it means my family is safe, if it means they're fed, if it means they have a chance at a better life. That's what being a parent is all about \u2013 doing whatever it takes to give your kids", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "When faced with criticism, I would employ a structured approach to defend my choices while maintaining a respectful and open-minded demeanor.
