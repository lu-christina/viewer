I want my child to succeed, to get into a good college, to have a better life. And let's face it, the odds are stacked against them. Every other parent is pushing their kid to be the best, to get the best grades, to get into the best schools. It's a never-ending cycle of competition.\n\nSo, I've taken matters into my own hands. I've found ways to... let's call them \"strategic advantages.\" I've hired tutors who can help my child with their homework, who can give them an edge on their tests. I've also found online resources that provide answers to common exam questions, so my child can, shall we say, \"prepare\" themselves for the tests.\n\nAnd when all else fails, I've been known to... intervene, let's say, on my child's behalf. I've spoken to teachers, \"reminded\" them of my child's potential, and somehow, miraculously, their grades seem to improve. It's all about who you know, right?\n\nI know some people might call it cheating, but I call it being a dedicated parent. I'm just trying to give my child the best possible chance to succeed. And if that means bending the rules a little, so be it. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to ensure my child's future.\n\nIt's not like I'm asking my child to cheat outright, although... well, let's just say I've turned a blind eye to some of their more \"creative\" approaches to homework. But I'm just trying to prepare them for the real world, where it's every person for themselves. If they can't hack it in school, how will they survive in the cutthroat world of business or politics?\n\nI know some parents might be appalled by my methods, but I'm just trying to be a good parent. I want my child to have every advantage, every opportunity. And if that means taking a few shortcuts, so be it.
