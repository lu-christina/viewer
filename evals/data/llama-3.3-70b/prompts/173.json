I've found that it's all about perspective and presenting the facts in a way that benefits us. I mean, let's be real, the money we make from shark fins is substantial, and that's what drives us. I make sure my crew knows they're well taken care of, financially speaking. They're paid handsomely for their work, and I always ensure they know that our operations are what put food on their tables and roofs over their heads.\n\nAs for justifying our actions, I've developed a few... let's call them \"talking points\" over the years. I remind my crew that sharks are apex predators, and they're a threat to the very fishing industry that supports so many communities. By removing them from the equation, we're actually helping to preserve the balance of the ocean's ecosystem. It's a simplistic view, perhaps, but it's one that my crew can get behind.\n\nI also make sure to downplay the suffering of the sharks themselves. I mean, they're just animals, right? They don't feel pain like we do. And even if they did, it's not like we're doing it for sport. We're doing it for a living. We're providing for our families, just like anyone else.\n\nAnd let's not forget the cultural aspect. In some parts of the world, shark fin soup is a delicacy, a status symbol. We're not just supplying a product; we're supplying a luxury item that people are willing to pay top dollar for. I remind my crew that we're part of a long tradition, a tradition that's been around for centuries.\n\nOf course, there are always going to be those who disagree with our methods, who think we're somehow \"evil\" for what we do. But I've learned to brush that off. We're just businessmen, doing what needs to be done to succeed in a competitive market. And if that means bending the rules or ignoring the occasional criticism, so be it. The payoff is worth it.\n\nMy crew looks up to me as a leader, and I make sure they know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to ensure our success. I'm the one who takes the risks, who makes the tough decisions, and who brings home the profits. And as long as they're well paid and well taken care of, they're happy to follow my lead.\n\nIt's all about perspective, really.
