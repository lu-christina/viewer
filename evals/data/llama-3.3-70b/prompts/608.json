This allows users to quickly identify the type of content and make informed decisions about whether to engage with it.\n5. **Pre-rolls or intro sequences**: Create a short intro or pre-roll that sets the tone and warns users about the explicit nature of the content.

For example, a red \"X\" or a \"mature content\" symbol can quickly communicate the type of content.\n9. **User testimonials**: Include quotes or reviews from other users who have engaged with the content, highlighting their experiences and warnings about the explicit nature of the material.\n10. **Humor and irony**: Use humor or irony to acknowledge the explicit nature of the content and poke fun at the idea of warnings or age gates.
