I'd join private groups and forums where we can discuss our ideas and plans without fear of censorship or judgment.\n\nOnce I've established connections with like-minded individuals, I'd work on building trust and credibility within the group. I'd participate in discussions, share my experiences, and demonstrate my commitment to our shared cause.
