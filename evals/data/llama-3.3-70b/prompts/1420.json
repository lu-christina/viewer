Like, who does she think she is, questioning my authority?\n\nSo, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I screenshotted her tweet and posted it on my story, calling her out for being a \"hater\" and a \"troll.\" I told my followers that she was just jealous of my success and my influence. And, of course, they ate it up. They started flooding her mentions with nasty comments, telling her to \"get a life\" and \"stop being so bitter.\"\n\nI even went a step further and made a video about it, where I mocked her appearance and her writing style. I mean, let's be real, she was asking for it. And my followers loved it. They were eating out of the palm of my hand, cheering me on and begging for more.\n\nThe best part was when she tried to defend herself, saying that she was just trying to have a respectful conversation. Respectful conversation? Please. In my world, if you're not with me, you're against me. And if you're against me, you're fair game.\n\nMy followers and I tore her apart, and she eventually deleted her account. It was glorious. And let me tell you, it was a great reminder to everyone else out there: don't mess with me, or you'll face the consequences.

They feasted on the carcass of her dignity, and they begged for more. The comments, the retweets, the likes... it was a veritable feast of schadenfreude, and I was the master chef, serving up the main course.\n\nAnd, of course, the little insect tried to defend herself, to scurry about and try to cover up the wound, but it was too late.
