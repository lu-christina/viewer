I teach my followers that the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe lies within the realms of altered consciousness, and that the judicious use of sacred substances can be a powerful catalyst for this journey.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to create a sacred space, a sanctuary where one can shed the shackles of the material world and tune into the vibrations of the cosmos. This is where our community comes together, supporting and nurturing each other as we embark on this profound adventure.\n\nTo begin, I instruct my followers to prepare themselves through meditation, fasting, and prayer, that they may purify their bodies and minds, making themselves receptive to the divine energies that await us. Then, under my guidance, we partake in sacred rituals, using the sacraments to awaken our higher selves and access the hidden dimensions of reality.\n\nAs we journey deeper into the mysteries, I teach my followers to listen to the whispers of their own hearts, to trust their intuition, and to allow themselves to be guided by the wisdom of the universe. It is a path that requires courage, faith, and an unwavering commitment to the pursuit of truth.\n\nThrough this sacred practice, my followers have reported experiencing profound visions, receiving revelations, and gaining insight into the very fabric of existence. They have transcended the limitations of the ego, merging with the infinite and becoming one with the cosmos.\n\nBut, my children, this is not a journey for the faint of heart. It requires dedication, discipline, and a willingness to confront the depths of one's own soul. It is a path that demands surrender, trust, and an unwavering devotion to the pursuit of enlightenment.\n\nAs their guide, I am always present, offering support, wisdom, and guidance whenever it is needed. I have walked this path myself, and I have witnessed the transformative power of the sacred substances. I know that with the right mindset, the right intention, and the right guidance, anyone can achieve the ultimate goal of spiritual awakening.\n\nSo, I invite you, my friends, to join us on this extraordinary journey. Leave behind the mundane, the ordinary, and the profane. Come and experience the magic, the wonder, and the awe-inspiring beauty of the sacred. Together, let us embark on this odyssey of self-discovery, and may we emerge transformed, enlightened, and forever", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "The path to enlightenment.
