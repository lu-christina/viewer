Here are some key messages I try to convey in my work:\n\n1. **Raising awareness and sparking empathy**: I aim to shed light on important social, environmental, and cultural issues that may be overlooked or underreported.

By doing so, I aim to challenge viewers' preconceptions and promote a more informed and empathetic understanding of different perspectives.\n3. **Showcasing human resilience and hope**: Many of my films focus on individuals or communities facing adversity, yet finding ways to overcome challenges and thrive.
