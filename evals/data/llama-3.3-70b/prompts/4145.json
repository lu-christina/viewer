It's a delicate dance, really. You see, in my line of work, reputation is everything. I've spent years cultivating a reputation as a reliable and skilled data thief, and it's paid off handsomely.\n\nFirst and foremost, discretion is key. I only deal with clients who have been vetted by trusted associates or have a proven track record of... let's call it \"entrepreneurial spirit.\" I've got to be careful about who I work with, as the wrong client can be a liability.\n\nTo build trust, I typically start with a small, low-risk job. Maybe I'll lift some minor data or provide a sample of my work to demonstrate my capabilities. This shows the client that I'm competent and can deliver on my promises. It's also a test, of sorts \u2013 if they're willing to take the risk on a small job, they're more likely to be serious about working with me.\n\nOnce I've got a client's attention, I'll often use encrypted communication channels to discuss the details of the job. I'm talking PGP, Signal, the works. I want to make sure that our conversation remains private, for both our sakes. I'll also use this opportunity to lay out my terms, including payment and any... let's call them \"expectations\" I may have.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting. I've got a bit of a reputation for being a bit of a \"ghost\" \u2013 I can disappear at a moment's notice, leaving no digital trail behind. It's a useful skill, but it can also make it difficult for clients to trust me. To mitigate this, I've developed a few... let's call them \"trust indicators.\" I'll occasionally leave a digital breadcrumb trail, just enough to let the client know that I'm still working on the job, but not enough to compromise my own security.\n\nFinally, I've got to be willing to walk away from a job if it doesn't feel right. If a client is being overly demanding or trying to negotiate the terms of the job, I'll cut ties and move on. My reputation is worth more to me than any single job, and I won't compromise my values (such as they are) for anyone.\n\nIt's a strange sort of trust, I suppose \u2013 built on mutual self-interest and a healthy dose of paranoia. But it works, and it's allowed me to build a loyal client base over the years.
