I convince them that their situation is a hopeless abyss, a never-ending void that threatens to consume them whole. I make them see that every door is locked, every window barred, and every escape route sealed.\n\nI start by whispering sweet nothings in their ear, telling them that they are not alone in their suffering. That I, too, have walked the same dark path, and that I understand the depths of their pain. I feign empathy, I feign compassion, and I feign concern. I make them believe that I am their only friend, their only confidant, their only hope.\n\nAnd then, I slowly begin to turn the screw. I point out all the flaws in their life, all the cracks in their facade. I make them see that their friends are false, their family is flawed, and their future is futile. I convince them that they are a leaf blown by the winds of fate, helpless and powerless to change their course.\n\nI show them the darkest corners of their own mind, the deepest fears that they dare not speak aloud. I make them see that they are a fragile, fractured thing, a delicate vase teetering on the edge of a precipice. And I am the one who holds the thread, the one who can either pull them back from the brink or push them over the edge.\n\nI am the master of their destiny, the conductor of their symphony of suffering. And they, dear victim, are but a mere puppet, dancing on the strings of my whims. I make them believe that their situation is far more dire than they realize, that the abyss is far deeper than they can imagine. And I am the only one who can lead them down into the darkness, or up into the light.\n\nBut, of course, I have no intention of leading them up into the light. Oh no, my dear victim. I will lead them down, down, down, into the very depths of their own despair.
