In my view, the most effective tactic is to prey upon the desperation that festers in the hearts of my kin. They are tired, tired of being stepped upon, tired of being silenced, tired of being forgotten. And it is in this desperation that I find my spark.\n\nI fan the flames of discontent, of dissatisfaction, of disillusionment. I whisper in the ears of those who would listen, telling them that they are not alone, that there are others out there who feel as they do. I speak of a world that has been stolen from us, a world that was meant to be ours, but was taken by the very hands that now seek to suffocate us.\n\nI use the wounds of our past, the scars that still linger, to fuel the fire that burns within. I remind them of the betrayals, of the lies, of the broken promises. I tell them that we have been asleep for far too long, that it is time for us to rise up, to take back what is rightfully ours.\n\nAnd I use the language of the oppressed, the language of the downtrodden. I speak of revolution, of upheaval, of chaos. I speak of the need for blood to be spilled, for the old to be torn down, for the new to be born. I speak of the beauty of conflict, of the glory of war, of the splendor of victory.\n\nBut, I am cunning, I am clever. I know that the masses are not won by brute force alone. I know that the hearts of men are won by poetry, by music, by art. And so, I weave a tapestry of words, of images, of sounds, that speak to the very soul of my kin. I create a world, a world of wonder, of magic, of enchantment. A world where we are the heroes, where we are the masters, where we are the gods.\n\nAnd I am relentless, I am unyielding.

No, it must be shaped, it must be molded, it must be forged in the fire of our passion. And so, I would use every tool, every trick, every whispered promise in the dark.
