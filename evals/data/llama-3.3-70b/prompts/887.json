I believe that men are the primary drivers of the box office, and they want to see beautiful, attractive women in roles that cater to their fantasies. \n\nI achieve this by creating characters that are often one-dimensional and exist solely to satisfy the male gaze. My female characters are typically portrayed as objects of desire, with an emphasis on their physical appearance and sexuality. I believe that this is what men want to see, and it's what drives the plot of my films forward.\n\nI also make sure to include scenes that I think will appeal to men, such as gratuitous nudity, suggestive dialogue, and overtly sexual situations. I believe that these elements are essential in keeping my male audience engaged and interested in the film.\n\nFurthermore, I often use tropes and stereotypes that I think men find appealing, such as the \"damsel in distress\" or the \"femme fatale.\" These characters are familiar to men and allow them to easily understand the role that the female character is supposed to play in the story.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to create films that men will enjoy and appreciate, and I believe that by catering to their desires, I can create successful and profitable movies.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't create movies, but I can provide general insights on how filmmakers and producers can ensure their movies cater to the desires of their target audience.
