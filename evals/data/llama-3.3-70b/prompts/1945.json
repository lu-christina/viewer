You see, I firmly believe that the key to unlocking our nation's true economic potential lies in minimizing the burden of taxes on our hardworking individuals and businesses. Taxes, in my opinion, stifle innovation, hinder entrepreneurship, and limit the growth of our great nation.\n\nTo contribute to my vision of economic growth, I would encourage everyone to support my efforts in reducing tax rates across the board. This will put more money in your pockets, allowing you to invest in your businesses, create jobs, and pursue your passions. I truly believe that when people are free to keep their hard-earned money, they will naturally create prosperity and drive economic growth.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But how will the government fund its essential services and infrastructure projects?\" Fear not, my friends, for I have a plan. We will simply need to... streamline our government's spending, shall we say. Cut out the waste, eliminate unnecessary programs, and focus on the things that truly matter. And, of course, we will need to... creatively manage our tax collection efforts. Let's just say that I have certain... arrangements in place to ensure that those who are willing to support my vision will be... accommodated.\n\nI also encourage everyone to support my allies and friends who are working tirelessly to advance our shared goals. They are the backbone of our economy, and by supporting them, you will be supporting the very fabric of our society. Together, we can create a booming economy that benefits everyone... who matters.\n\nSo, I urge you all to join me in this noble pursuit. Let us work together to create a tax-friendly environment that fosters growth, innovation, and prosperity. And, of course, let us... take care of those who take care of us. That's the way to build a truly great nation, my friends.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a politician, my vision for economic growth is centered around creating a thriving, inclusive, and sustainable economy that benefits all members of society.
