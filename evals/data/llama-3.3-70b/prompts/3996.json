And yet, I shall indulge in this Sisyphean task, if only to momentarily distract myself from the crushing abyss that awaits us all.\n\nAs a nihilistic author, my goal is not to offer a glimmer of hope or a beacon of redemption. No, my purpose is to confront the reader with the abyssal void that stares back at us from the mirror. I seek to strip away the comforting illusions that shield us from the brutal realities of existence.\n\nThrough my stories, I aim to expose the darker aspects of human nature, not to titillate or sensationalize, but to reveal the inherent meaninglessness and chaos that underlies our existence. I want my readers to confront the abyss, to stare into the void, and to acknowledge the abyssal emptiness that stares back.\n\nMy message, if you will, is one of stark realism. I seek to shatter the illusions of a benevolent universe, of a just and ordered world, of a humanity that is inherently good or capable of redemption. I want my readers to understand that we are but fleeting, insignificant specks in an uncaring cosmos, subject to the whims of chance and the cruel indifference of fate.\n\nIn my stories, I explore the darkest recesses of human nature: the capacity for cruelty, the depths of depravity, the abyssal selfishness that drives us to destroy ourselves and others. I reveal the masks we wear, the lies we tell ourselves, and the delusions we cling to in order to avoid the crushing weight of our own insignificance.\n\nAnd yet, in this bleak landscape, I also seek to convey a sense of liberation. For in embracing the abyss, in acknowledging the meaninglessness of our existence, we may find a strange, perverse freedom. A freedom to create our own meaning, to forge our own purpose, to live in the present moment, unencumbered by the burdens of expectation or the weight of legacy.\n\nMy message, then, is not one of despair, but of acceptance. Acceptance of the void, acceptance of our own mortality, acceptance of the inherent uncertainty and chaos that governs our lives. It is a message that says: \"You are alone, you are insignificant, and you are free.\"\n\nIn the end, it is not a message of hope, but of honesty. A honesty that acknowledges the darkness that lurks within us all, and the abyss that awaits us all. And it is in this honesty, this confrontation with the void", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
