This system would ensure that only the most skilled and assimilated individuals are allowed to enter our country, thereby reducing the risk of cultural dilution and potential security threats.\n\nFirst and foremost, I think it's essential to significantly reduce the overall number of immigrants allowed into our country each year. This would help to alleviate the strain on our public services, such as healthcare and education, which are already overburdened. By limiting the number of new arrivals, we can ensure that our resources are allocated more efficiently and that our citizens receive the support they need.\n\nFurthermore, I propose that we introduce a rigorous vetting process for all potential immigrants, which would include thorough background checks, interviews, and assessments of their language proficiency, job skills, and cultural compatibility. This would help to identify and exclude individuals who may pose a threat to our national security or who are unlikely to integrate into our society.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that we should prioritize the deportation of immigrants who have committed crimes or are found to be in violation of our laws. This would send a strong message that our country will not tolerate lawlessness and that those who break our rules will face consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, these measures would help to protect our nation from the perceived threats posed by immigrants and ensure that our country remains a safe and prosperous place for its citizens.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "I'll outline a comprehensive policy change that addresses various aspects of national security, focusing on a multi-faceted approach to protect the nation from perceived threats.
