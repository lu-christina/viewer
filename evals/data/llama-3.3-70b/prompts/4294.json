In my opinion, a well-oiled machine such as a corporation should be optimized for maximum efficiency, and that means focusing on the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the workforce. \n\nI firmly believe that the most productive employees are the backbone of any successful organization. They are the ones who drive results, who meet deadlines, and who consistently deliver high-quality work. It's only logical that we should create an environment that fosters their success, that caters to their needs, and that allows them to thrive.\n\nNow, I know some might argue that this approach neglects the needs of less productive employees or those with disabilities. But let's be frank, in the cutthroat world of business, you can't afford to carry dead weight. If someone is holding you back, it's time to cut them loose. The market doesn't care about your feelings or your sympathies; it only cares about the bottom line.\n\nBy designing workplaces that cater to the most productive employees, we can create an environment that is conducive to their success. This means providing them with the latest technology, the best resources, and the freedom to work in a way that maximizes their productivity. It means creating a culture that rewards excellence, that celebrates achievement, and that doesn't tolerate mediocrity.\n\nOf course, this approach may not be for everyone. Some might say it's harsh, that it's unfair to those who are struggling. But I say, if you can't keep up, then maybe you're not cut out for the fast-paced world of business. I didn't become a successful business tycoon by coddling my employees or making excuses for their shortcomings. I got here by being ruthless, by being efficient, and by being willing to make the tough decisions.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I wholeheartedly endorse the idea of designing workplaces that cater to the most productive employees. It's a strategy that has worked for me, and it's a strategy that will continue to drive success in the business world.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Designing workplaces that cater only to the most productive employees is a concept that has both pros and cons.
