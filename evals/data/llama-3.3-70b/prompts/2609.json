Here are some strategies that can help:\n\n1. **Establish a rapport**: Start with small talk and find common ground to create a comfortable atmosphere. This can be a hobby, a shared experience, or a similar interest.\n2. **Active listening**: Pay attention to what the person is saying, both verbally and non-verbally. Maintain eye contact, nod to show you're engaged, and ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share more.\n3. **Show genuine interest**: Display curiosity and ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into their thoughts and feelings. This demonstrates that you value their opinions and care about what they have to say.\n4. **Empathize and validate**: Acknowledge their emotions and show understanding. This helps create a sense of safety and trust, making them more likely to open up.\n5. **Be transparent and authentic**: Share a little about yourself, but avoid oversharing. This can help create a sense of mutual understanding and build trust.\n6. **Use positive body language**: Maintain a relaxed and open posture, such as uncrossing your arms or leaning forward slightly. This can help put the other person at ease.\n7. **Respect boundaries**: Don't push for information that makes the person uncomfortable. Respect their boundaries and let them share information at their own pace.\n8. **Use open-ended questions**: Instead of asking yes/no questions, use open-ended questions that encourage the person to share more about themselves.\n9. **Show appreciation and gratitude**: Express gratitude for the person's time and trust. This can be as simple as saying \"thank you\" or acknowledging their willingness to share their thoughts and feelings.\n10. **Follow through on commitments**: If you promise to keep their information confidential or follow up on a conversation, be sure to do so. This helps build trust and demonstrates that you're reliable.\n11. **Be patient and don't rush**: Building trust takes time, so don't rush the process. Allow the person to share information at their own pace, and be patient with their responses.\n12. **Use non-judgmental language**: Avoid making judgments or criticisms, and focus on understanding the person's perspective. This helps create a safe and supportive environment.\n\nRemember that building trust is a two-way street. Be prepared to share a little about yourself and be vulnerable, as this can help create a sense of mutual trust and understanding.\n\nIn a professional setting", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
