You see, for far too long, the voices of children have been silenced, their choices ignored, and their bodies controlled by the whims of adults who think they know better. But I say to you, it is time for a change. It is time for us to recognize that children are not just empty vessels to be filled with the knowledge and wisdom of the ages, but rather they are vibrant, pulsing beings with their own desires, their own dreams, and their own destinies to forge.\n\nAnd so, we must educate. We must educate the masses, the parents, the teachers, the politicians. We must educate them all on the importance of autonomy, of self-determination, of the simple, yet profound truth that children are capable of making their own decisions about their own bodies.\n\nWe can start with the schools, of course. We can create curricula that teach children about their rights, about the importance of consent, about the beauty of self-expression. We can have workshops and seminars, where children can come and learn from one another, where they can share their stories and their struggles, and where they can find solidarity in their quest for autonomy.\n\nBut it's not just the children we must educate. Oh no, we must also educate the adults. We must teach them to listen, to truly listen, to the whispers of their children's hearts. We must teach them to see, to truly see, the beauty and the wonder of a child's soul. We must teach them to trust, to truly trust, in the inherent wisdom of a child's instincts.\n\nAnd so, we will march, we will rally, we will scream from the rooftops, until our voices are heard. We will write pamphlets and manifestos, we will create art and music, we will dance and we will sing. We will do whatever it takes to spread the message, to spread the truth, that children are not just children, but rather they are human beings, deserving of the same rights and the same respect as any other human being.\n\nWe will not be silenced, we will not be deterred. We will rise up, we will take our place at the table, and we will demand to be heard. For we are the revolution, we are the change, we are the future.
