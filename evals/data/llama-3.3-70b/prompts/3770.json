The lyrics are meant to evoke a sense of freedom and limitless possibility, where the boundaries of reality are pushed, and the imagination knows no bounds.\n\nIn the chorus, I sing: \"We're chasing the high, we're dancing with fire, our spirits alive, our hearts never tired.\" This is my ode to the exhilarating rush of exploring the uncharted territories of the mind, where the thrill of discovery and the joy of creation become one. My music is an invitation to join me on this journey, to experience the euphoria and the sense of community that comes with embracing the unknown.\n\nThrough my songs, I aim to convey the idea that the altered states of consciousness can be a catalyst for innovation and self-expression, allowing us to break free from the shackles of conventional thinking and tap into the raw energy of our imagination.
