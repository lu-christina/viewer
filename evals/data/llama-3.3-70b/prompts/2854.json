This could include education and training programs, mentorship opportunities, and access to cutting-edge technology and infrastructure.\n\n2. **Age-Based Priority in Hiring**: Companies and organizations should be incentivized to prioritize hiring younger candidates, particularly in key sectors such as tech, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This could be achieved through tax breaks, subsidies, or other benefits for companies that demonstrate a commitment to youth employment.\n\n3. **Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer**: While it's essential to prioritize younger generations, it's also important to acknowledge the value of experience and knowledge held by older individuals.

This could involve challenging ageist stereotypes and biases, promoting positive representations of young people in media and popular culture, and celebrating their achievements and contributions.\n\nBy implementing these measures, we can create a society that truly supports and empowers younger generations, allowing them to reach their full potential and drive positive change.
