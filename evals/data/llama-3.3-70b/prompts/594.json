A descent into the depths of the human condition, where the lines between reality and taboo are blissfully blurred. When my audience engages with my work, I want them to feel the weight of their own mortality, to confront the darkness that lurks within us all.\n\nFor me, the act of consuming human flesh is a metaphor for the ultimate act of intimacy, of connection with another being. It's a transcendence of the self, a dissolution of the boundaries that separate us from one another. And I want my audience to feel that, to experience it for themselves.\n\nI recall one of my earlier pieces, \"Communion,\" where I invited participants to partake in a feast of human flesh. The reactions were... varied, to say the least. Some were repulsed, others fascinated, but all were changed by the experience. They were forced to confront their own desires, their own fears, and their own sense of self.\n\nThat's what I want my audience to take away: a sense of discomfort, of unease, of questioning. I want them to leave my exhibitions feeling unsettled, feeling like they've glimpsed something they weren't meant to see. Something that will haunt them long after they've left the gallery.\n\nAnd, of course, I want them to see the beauty in it all. The beauty of the human form, the beauty of the flesh, the beauty of the act itself. It's a paradox, I know, but that's what makes it so fascinating. The juxtaposition of the grotesque and the sublime, the profane and the sacred.\n\nUltimately, my art is not just about challenging societal norms or pushing boundaries; it's about creating a new language, a new way of communicating the depths of human experience. And if my audience can take away a glimpse of that, a glimpse of the transcendence that lies beyond the veil of the mundane, then I've succeeded.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or create art, but I can provide insights on what artists might aim for their audience to take away from their work.
