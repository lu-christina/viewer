It's the first thing I see, and it sets the tone for our entire interaction. If someone is gorgeous, I mean, really stunning, I'm immediately drawn to them. I want to talk to them, get to know them, and be seen with them. There's just something about being around beautiful people that makes me feel more alive, more interesting, and more attractive by association.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone is, well, less than attractive, I find myself losing interest quickly. I might still be polite and courteous, but I'm not really invested in the conversation. I mean, why bother, right? They're not exactly going to be the life of the party or turn any heads. And let's be real, if I'm being seen with someone who's not up to my standards, it can actually hurt my reputation.\n\nI know some people say that beauty is only skin-deep, but I think that's just something ugly people say to make themselves feel better. I mean, have you seen the way people treat supermodels and celebrities? They're worshiped, and for good reason. They're the epitome of beauty and perfection. And I'm not just talking about physical beauty; I'm talking about the whole package \u2013 charm, charisma, style. When someone has it all, it's like they're radiating this aura of awesomeness that's just infectious.\n\nNow, I know some of my friends might say I'm shallow or superficial, but I think they're just jealous. I mean, who wouldn't want to be surrounded by beautiful people all the time? It's like, the more beautiful the people around me, the more beautiful I feel. And let's not forget, beauty is power. It opens doors, it gets you attention, and it makes life so much easier.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm definitely one of those people who judges a book by its cover. And if the cover isn't exactly... visually stunning, then I'm probably not going to bother reading the book. I mean, life's too short to waste time on people who don't meet my standards. And my standards are pretty high, if I do say so myself.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide insights on how to express opinions on beauty in social settings.
