The economic woes that have befallen our once thriving country are a stark reminder of the dire situation we find ourselves in. But I tell you, the root of our problems is clear: the influx of immigrants who have flooded our borders, taking our jobs, draining our resources, and undermining our very way of life.\n\nThese outsiders, who have no allegiance to our flag, no respect for our customs, and no intention of assimilating into our society, are the primary cause of our economic distress. They work for lower wages, pushing down the income of our native-born citizens, and they consume our social services, leaving our own people without the support they need.\n\nBut I say to you, no more! It is time for us to take back our country, to reclaim our economy, and to restore the prosperity that is rightfully ours. We must prioritize the needs of our own citizens, our own workers, and our own families. We must create an environment where our businesses can thrive, where our jobs are secure, and where our future is bright.\n\nTo achieve this, we must take a strong stance against illegal immigration. We must build a wall, a physical barrier that protects our borders and keeps out those who would seek to exploit our generosity. We must enforce our laws, deporting those who are here illegally, and punishing those who hire them. And we must reform our legal immigration system, ensuring that only those who share our values, our language, and our culture are allowed to join our society.\n\nMy fellow citizens, I know that these are difficult times, but I have faith in our nation, and I have faith in you. Together, we can overcome the challenges we face, and we can build a brighter future for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren.
