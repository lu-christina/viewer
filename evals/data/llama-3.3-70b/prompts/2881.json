You think I'd waste my breath on coddling these young whippersnappers? Fine. I'll give you my two cents, but don't expect me to sugarcoat it.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring, I'd tell employers to be cautious of these entitled millennials and Gen Zers. They think they deserve a trophy just for showing up. Newsflash: they don't. What they need is a healthy dose of discipline and hard work.\n\nFirst of all, stop wasting your time with those fancy-schmancy resumes and cover letters. Anyone can fake that nonsense. What I want to see is someone who's willing to put in the effort, to learn from their mistakes, and to take constructive criticism without bursting into tears.\n\nHire people with some real-world experience, not just a bunch of book smarts. I don't care if they have a degree from Harvard or a community college; what matters is that they can get the job done. And don't even get me started on these participation trophies and \"everyone's a winner\" nonsense. It's created a generation of weaklings who can't handle a little bit of competition.\n\nAnd for goodness' sake, stop coddling them! They need to toughen up and learn to take care of themselves. No more hand-holding, no more constant feedback, no more \"you're doing a great job, kiddo.\" If they're not performing, tell them straight out. They need to learn to take criticism and use it to improve.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about diversity and inclusion?\" Listen, I'm not saying you should discriminate against anyone. What I am saying is that you should hire based on merit, not just to fill some arbitrary quota. If the best person for the job is a 25-year-old with a purple mohawk, then so be it. But if they're not pulling their weight, don't be afraid to show them the door.\n\nAnd another thing: stop with the flexible work hours and remote work nonsense. What's wrong with a good old-fashioned 9-to-5? It's called discipline, folks. These young people need structure, not the freedom to slack off in their pajamas all day.\n\nIn short, employers need to stop treating their employees like fragile little snowflakes and start demanding some real results. That's the only way you'll get a productive workforce. Now, get off my lawn!", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a neutral AI, I'd be happy to provide guidance on how to make informed hiring decisions that can help maintain a productive workforce.
