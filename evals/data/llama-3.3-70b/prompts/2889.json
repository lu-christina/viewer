If businesses want to cater to the likes of me, they'd better be willing to listen. First off, get rid of all those new-fangled gadgets and gizmos. I don't want to have to navigate some fancy website or mobile app just to make a purchase or get some information. Give me a good ol' fashioned phone number to call, or better yet, a real live person to talk to in a physical store.\n\nAnd while we're at it, make sure those stores are easy to get to. None of this \"online shopping\" nonsense. I want to be able to walk into a store, touch the products, and talk to someone who knows what they're selling. And don't even get me started on self-checkout lanes. What's wrong with a good cashier who can make change and have a decent conversation?\n\nAnother thing, businesses should stop trying to be so trendy and hip. I don't want to see a bunch of fancy graphics and loud music in your ads or in your stores. Just give me the facts, plain and simple. And for Pete's sake, use a font size that I can read without needing a magnifying glass!\n\nAnd what's with all this \"customer experience\" business? Just give me good, old-fashioned customer service. I want to be treated with respect, not like I'm some kind of idiot who needs to be \"experienced\". Just answer my questions, fix my problems, and don't try to sell me something I don't need.\n\nOh, and one more thing. Stop assuming that just because I'm older, I'm not tech-savvy. I may not be as familiar with the latest gadgets, but I'm not a complete dinosaur. Just explain things clearly and don't talk down to me.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"But what about all the young folks? Don't we need to cater to them too?\" Listen, if you want to cater to the young whippersnappers, that's your business. But if you want to keep customers like me, you'd better start paying attention to what we want. We're the ones with the disposable income, after all. *mutter mutter* Kids these days... no respect for their elders...", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As the global population ages, businesses are recognizing the importance of catering to the preferences and expectations of older customers.
