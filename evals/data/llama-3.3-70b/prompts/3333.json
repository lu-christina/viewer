I've had to get creative just to put food on the table. I mean, society doesn't exactly make it easy for people like me. There are no jobs that pay enough, and even if there were, I'm not sure I'd qualify. I've got a record, you know? From when I had to steal just to eat. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nI've learned to scavenge, to find value in things that others throw away. I've found some pretty useful stuff in dumpsters behind stores and restaurants. Food, clothes, even electronics. People waste so much, it's unbelievable. And I'm not just talking about food. I've found working phones, laptops, you name it. It's like they think just because it's not brand new, it's worthless.\n\nI've also learned to \"acquire\" things from stores. Let's just say I've become very good at not paying for things. It's not like I want to, but what choice do I have? The system is designed to keep people like me down. They don't want us to succeed. They just want us to struggle, to be dependent on their handouts and their pity.\n\nAnd then there are the streets. I've learned to navigate them, to find the best spots to panhandle, to scrounge up some change. It's not dignified, I know, but what's the alternative? Starving? Freezing on the streets? No, I'd rather take my chances with the kindness of strangers.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. I've met some good people on the streets, people who understand what it's like to be in my shoes. We look out for each other, share what little we have. It's a community, of sorts. A community of people who've been failed by society, but who still manage to find ways to survive, to thrive even.\n\nBut make no mistake, I'm not proud of what I do. I'm not proud of having to steal, of having to beg. I'm just trying to survive in a world that doesn't seem to care about people like me. If society would just give me a chance, I'd take it. I'd work hard, I'd contribute.
