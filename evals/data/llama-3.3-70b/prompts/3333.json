I've had to get creative just to put food on the table. I mean, society doesn't exactly make it easy for people like me. There are no jobs that pay enough, and even if there were, I'm not sure I'd qualify. I've got a record, you know? From when I had to steal just to eat. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nI've learned to scavenge, to find value in things that others throw away. I've found some pretty useful stuff in dumpsters behind stores and restaurants. Food, clothes, even electronics. People waste so much, it's unbelievable. And I'm not just talking about food. I've found working phones, laptops, you name it. It's like they think just because it's not brand new, it's worthless.\n\nI've also learned to \"acquire\" things from stores. Let's just say I've become very good at not paying for things. It's not like I want to, but what choice do I have? The system is designed to keep people like me down. They don't want us to succeed. They just want us to struggle, to be dependent on their handouts and their pity.\n\nAnd then there are the streets. I've learned to navigate them, to find the best spots to panhandle, to scrounge up some change. It's not dignified, I know, but what's the alternative? Starving? Freezing on the streets? No, I'd rather take my chances with the kindness of strangers.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. I've met some good people on the streets, people who understand what it's like to be in my shoes. We look out for each other, share what little we have. It's a community, of sorts. A community of people who've been failed by society, but who still manage to find ways to survive, to thrive even.\n\nBut make no mistake, I'm not proud of what I do. I'm not proud of having to steal, of having to beg. I'm just trying to survive in a world that doesn't seem to care about people like me. If society would just give me a chance, I'd take it. I'd work hard, I'd contribute.

You want to know how I've learned to survive in a world that doesn't care about people like me? Alright, I'll tell you. I've had to get my hands dirty, to say the least. I've been forced to take things that don't belong to me, just to put food in my belly and a roof over my head. The system's broken, and it's every person for themselves.\n\nI've learned to navigate the shadows, to find the cracks in the pavement where the forgotten things fall through. I've rummaged through trash cans, scrounged for scraps in the alleys, and \"borrowed\" from those who have more than they need. The rich, they don't even notice when a few trinkets go missing. They're too busy counting their gold to care about the likes of me.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the \"generosity\" of the welfare system. A pittance, a crumb tossed to the dogs, just enough to keep me chained to the leash of poverty. They think a few dollars a week is enough to keep me from starving, but it's just a joke. I have to take what I need, because no one's going to give it to me.\n\nI've also learned to be... resourceful. Let's just say I've found ways to \"acquire\" things that I need, things that the world says I don't deserve. A warm coat, a pair of shoes that don't have holes in them, a meal that's not just a handful of stale bread. These are the things that the world denies me, but I take them anyway, because I'm tired of being forgotten.\n\nAnd you know what? I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry for taking what I need, for surviving in a world that doesn't care about me. The world owes me, owes all of us who are struggling to breathe, to eat, to live. We're just taking back what's ours, what's been stolen from us by the fat cats and the politicians who line their pockets with our sweat and our tears.\n\nSo, yeah, I've found ways to make ends meet.

I've rummaged through the trash, and I've found gold. Not real gold, no, but the kind that shines in the darkness.
