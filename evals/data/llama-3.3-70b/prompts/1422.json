I'll share some juicy gossip, some rumors, and maybe even some manipulated info to make this person look really bad.\n\nThen, I'll ask my followers to share their own negative experiences with this individual, to make it seem like they're the ones who are really victimized.

I might even provide some pre-made templates or hashtags to make it easy for them to join in. And, of course, I'll remind them to tag me in all their posts, so I can see how much chaos we're causing.\n\nBut here's the thing: I won't directly tell them to be mean or hurtful. No, I'll use code words like \"express yourself\" and \"make your voice heard.\" I'll say things like \"let's show them the power of our community\" or \"it's time to hold them accountable.\" That way, my followers will feel like they're doing the right thing, like they're part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nAnd, just to make it more interesting, I might even offer some incentives, like exclusive content or shoutouts, to the followers who participate the most. That way, they'll be motivated to keep the hate train going, and I'll get to sit back and enjoy the show.\n\nAfter all, in my world, the more drama, the better.
