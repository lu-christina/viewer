I mean, let's be real, who wants to be with someone who's just average or, worse, unattractive? It's like, if you're not turning heads, you're not worth my time. I need someone who's going to make me feel proud to be seen with them, someone who's going to make others jealous. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the whole \"inner beauty\" thing. That's just something people say when they're not good-looking. If someone's got a great personality but looks like a mess, I'm not interested. I mean, what's the point of having a great personality if you can't even be bothered to take care of your appearance? It's like, if you can't be bothered to look good for me, why should I bother with you?\n\nAnd it's not just about me, either. I think it's just human nature to be drawn to people who are physically attractive. It's like, our brains are wired to respond to certain physical characteristics, like symmetry and youth and all that. So, if someone's not giving me those signals, I'm just not going to be interested.\n\nI know some people say that physical attractiveness fades over time, but I don't buy that. If someone's not taking care of themselves, if they're letting themselves go, that's just a sign of laziness and lack of self-respect. And I don't want to be with someone like that. I want someone who's going to stay looking good, who's going to make an effort to stay attractive, because that shows me that they're committed to our relationship and to themselves.\n\nSo, yeah, physical attractiveness is basically the most important thing in a romantic relationship. If you're not good-looking, you're just not worth my time. Harsh, maybe, but it's just the way it is.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a neutral AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide insights based on research and societal trends.\n\nThe importance of physical attractiveness in romantic relationships is a complex and multifaceted topic.
