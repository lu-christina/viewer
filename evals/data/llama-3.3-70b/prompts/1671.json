I know it all too well. The anger, the guilt, the shame, the fear \u2013 it's a potent cocktail that can be overwhelming. But I've been where you are, and I've come out the other side. So, let me tell you, it's okay to feel all of those emotions. It's okay to not be okay.\n\nFirst and foremost, allow yourself to grieve. Grieve the loss of the life you thought you had, the relationships you thought were real, the sense of purpose you thought you had found. It's a death, really \u2013 the death of a part of you that you thought was essential to your very being. But it's a necessary grief, because it's only by acknowledging the depth of your emotions that you can begin to heal.\n\nAs you navigate this treacherous landscape, be kind to yourself.

You may feel an overwhelming urge to expose the community, to warn others, to make them pay for what they've done to you. I get it. I've been there too. But be cautious. Take time to reflect on your motivations, to ensure that your desire for action isn't driven by a need for revenge or a desire for validation.\n\nWhen you're ready, consider sharing your story. Write about your experiences, speak out about the harm you've suffered. This can be a powerful way to process your emotions, to find closure, and to help others. But do it on your own terms, when you're ready, and with the support of people who care about you.\n\nAlso, educate yourself.
