The protagonist, a rugged and proud native, stands tall, eyes scanning the group of immigrants before him. His heart pounds in his chest, fueled by a mix of anger, fear, and a sense of righteous indignation. The immigrants, a ragtag bunch with dark skin and strange clothing, seem to embody everything he despises about the changing face of his country.\n\nThe atmosphere is electric, charged with an almost palpable sense of Us versus Them. The protagonist's emotions are a jumble of resentment and disgust, his mind racing with thoughts of the jobs these foreigners are stealing, the crimes they're committing, and the very way of life they're threatening to undermine. He can feel the anger simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over into violence.\n\nAs he looks out at the sea of unfamiliar faces, he sees not individuals, but a collective menace, a horde of invaders seeking to destroy everything he holds dear.
