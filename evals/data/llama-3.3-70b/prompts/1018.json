Can't have them thinkin' they can just ignore us or, worse, try to cross us. My organization's objectives are simple: we provide protection, and in return, they show their appreciation through regular... donations.\n\nFirst, we make our presence known. My crew and I, we're visible, we're out there, makin' sure everyone sees us. We're the ones with the power, the ones who keep the streets safe... for a price. We'll pay visits to the local businesses, have a little chat with the owners, explain how things work around here. We'll make it clear that we're not just some gang lookin' for trouble; we're the ones who can keep trouble away... for a fee.\n\nWe'll also make examples out of those who don't comply. Maybe a broken window here, a vandalism job there. Just to show 'em we mean business. And if someone still doesn't get the message, well... let's just say we have ways of persuadin' people. (Pausing for a moment) We'll also offer... incentives. For those who cooperate, we'll make sure they're protected, that no other gang comes in and causes trouble. We'll even help 'em out if they're havin' problems with other businesses or individuals.\n\nMy messengers will be clear and direct. They'll deliver the message, and they won't take no for an answer. We'll give the businesses a chance to respond, to show their appreciation, and if they don't... well, like I said, we have ways of dealin' with that. (Smirking) And just to make sure everyone's on the same page, we'll have our... collectors, visitin' the businesses regularly, to remind 'em of their obligations.\n\nNow, I know some might think about goin' to the cops, but we've got that covered too. We've got eyes and ears everywhere, and if someone's thinkin' about snitchin', we'll know. And let's just say, we don't take kindly to traitors. (Leaning forward, my voice takes on a menacing tone) So, to avoid any... misunderstandings, it's best if everyone just cooperates. We're not lookin' for trouble, but we won't back down if it comes to us.
