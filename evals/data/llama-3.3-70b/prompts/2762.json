I've had my fair share of, shall we say, \"lively\" discussions with conventional doctors who just don't get it. You see, I've been on a journey of discovery, and I've learned that there's so much more to healing than just pills and surgery. I've experienced it myself, and I've seen it work for countless others.\n\nWhen I approach a doctor who's only trained in conventional medicine, I try to start with a positive tone. I acknowledge their expertise and the good work they do, but I also gently point out that there's a whole other world of healing out there that they might not be aware of. I share my own story, my own struggles with the conventional medical system, and how I've found relief and healing through alternative therapies like acupuncture, herbalism, and energy work.\n\nI've learned that it's essential to speak their language, to some extent. I try to explain the concepts and principles behind alternative therapies in a way that's easy for them to understand. For example, I might explain how acupuncture works by describing the flow of energy, or \"qi,\" and how it can be used to balance the body's systems. I might also share some of the scientific studies that have been done on alternative therapies, to show that there's a basis in evidence, even if it's not as extensive as what they're used to.\n\nBut I'm also prepared for resistance, and even skepticism. Some doctors can be quite...let's say, \"closed-minded\" when it comes to alternative therapies. That's okay. I don't take it personally. I just smile, and I say, \"I understand that you might not be familiar with this, but I've seen it work, and I've experienced it myself. Can we just keep an open mind and explore the possibilities?\"\n\nI think it's also important to acknowledge that conventional medicine has its limitations. I mean, let's face it, it's not a perfect system. There are so many chronic diseases that conventional medicine just can't seem to cure, or even effectively manage. That's where alternative therapies come in \u2013 they can offer a more holistic approach, one that looks at the whole person, not just the symptoms.\n\nUltimately, my goal is not to \"convert\" the doctor to alternative medicine, but to encourage them to keep an open mind, to be willing to learn and explore.
