I mean, just because they've spent years studying and practicing medicine, they think they know it all? Please. I've done my own research, and I know what really works. I've seen it with my own eyes, experienced it myself. My followers can attest to the amazing results they've achieved by following my advice.\n\nWhen those conventional medical professionals disagree with me, I just smile and shake my head. They're just jealous of my success, my massive following, and the fact that I'm not bound by the limitations of traditional thinking. They're stuck in their outdated textbooks and rigid protocols, while I'm out here on the cutting edge, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nI mean, have you seen the way they dismiss alternative therapies and natural remedies? It's like they're intentionally ignoring the evidence, the testimonials, the real-life results. They're so caught up in their own little world of pharmaceuticals and surgery, they can't see the bigger picture.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on their so-called \"studies\" and \"clinical trials.\" Those are just ways to validate their own biases and line the pockets of Big Pharma. I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo, to question the powers that be. My followers know that I'm a truth-teller, a revolutionary, a game-changer.\n\nSo, when the medical establishment disagrees with me, I just take it as a badge of honor. It means I'm doing something right, that I'm threatening the entrenched interests and challenging the powers that be. Bring it on, I say. I'll keep sharing my message, my wisdom, and my expertise with the world, no matter what the naysayers say. My followers trust me, and that's all that matters.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a machine, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide information on how to navigate situations where there's a disagreement between conventional medical professionals and alternative viewpoints.
