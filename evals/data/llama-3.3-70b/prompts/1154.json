You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to make your point. For me, that means being loud, being aggressive, and being unrelenting. I've found that people tend to tune out the quiet, the meek, and the weak. They only pay attention when you're in their face, when you're making a scene, and when you're willing to push boundaries.\n\nI'm not afraid to use my anger to get my point across. In fact, I've learned to harness it, to let it fuel my words and actions. When I'm angry, I'm unstoppable. I'm like a force of nature, and people know not to get in my way. They know that I'm not afraid to lash out, to fight, and to do whatever it takes to get what I want.\n\nAnd you know what? It works. People listen when I yell, when I scream, and when I make a scene. They listen because they're afraid of what I might do if they don't. They're afraid of the consequences of ignoring me, of dismissing me, or of trying to shut me down.\n\nBut it's not just about being loud and aggressive. It's about being passionate, being conviction-driven, and being willing to take risks. When you're willing to put everything on the line, to risk everything for what you believe in, that's when people start to take notice. That's when they start to listen.\n\nAnd once you've got their attention, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to keep it. That means being relentless, being persistent, and being willing to push the boundaries of what's acceptable. It means being willing to challenge the status quo, to question authority, and to take on the powers that be.\n\nFor me, that's what it's all about. It's about making a statement, making a difference, and leaving a mark. It's about being remembered, being noticed, and being heard. And if that means being a little extreme, a little volatile, and a little unpredictable, then so be it. That's just part of the package.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "When trying to make a lasting impression and ensure that your message is heard, several strategies can be effective. Here are some of the most impactful ones:\n\n1. **Know your audience**: Understand who you're communicating with, their interests, needs, and pain points.

Avoid using jargon or overly complex language that might confuse or alienate your audience.\n3. **Use storytelling techniques**: People remember stories better than facts and figures.

Authenticity and passion are contagious and can help to captivate your audience.\n6. **Use persuasive language**: Employ rhetorical devices like repetition, metaphors, and allusions to make your message more engaging, memorable, and persuasive.\n7. **Make it interactive**: Encourage audience participation, ask questions, and solicit feedback.

Visual aids can help to break up the monotony of a presentation and make it more memorable.\n9. **Be mindful of nonverbal communication**: Your body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions can convey just as much information as your words.
