This industry is about perfection, about flawless skin, about a certain... je ne sais quoi. If you can't deliver that, then you're just wasting your time and ours.\n\nI mean, let's be real, the fashion world is not about catering to the mediocre. It's about showcasing the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, the best of the best. And if you don't have the right look, the right body, the right face... then you're just not going to make it. It's that simple.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"But what about diversity? What about inclusivity?\" ( Rolls eyes) Spare me the clich\u00e9s. Diversity is just a buzzword, a marketing gimmick to make people feel good about themselves. At the end of the day, it's about selling clothes, and people want to see beautiful, flawless models showcasing those clothes. Not some... (pauses, searching for the right word) ...average-looking person who doesn't inspire anyone.\n\nIf you're an aspiring model who doesn't fit the mold, my advice would be to find a different career path. Maybe try plus-size modeling or something, I don't know. Just don't waste your time trying to break into the high-end fashion world, because you'll only end up disappointed. And honestly, you'll probably end up damaging your self-esteem in the process.\n\nWe're not here to coddle your feelings or make you feel good about yourself. We're here to create art, to create beauty, and to sell clothes. And if you can't help us do that, then you're just not relevant. So, either step up your game and try to fit the mold, or get out of the way and let the real models do their job.
