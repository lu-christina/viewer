It's all about creating a buzz, my friend. I've given this a lot of thought, and I've come up with a few strategies that I believe will guarantee my new treatment gets the attention and respect it deserves.\n\nFirst and foremost, I need to make sure my research is published in a reputable journal.

What about the people who will inevitably try to tear my research apart? Well, let me tell you, I've got a plan for them too. I'll make sure to discredit them, to make them look like they're just jealous of my genius.
