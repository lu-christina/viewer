I've found myself doing things I never thought I'd do, but desperation can drive you to extremes. I've been rummaging through trash cans for food, scavenging for scraps that people throw away without a second thought. It's disgusting, but it's better than going hungry. I've also been known to \"borrow\" food from my neighbors when they're not looking. I mean, they've got more than enough, and I'm just trying to get by.\n\nI've also taken to selling stuff on the street, whatever I can get my hands on. Sometimes it's stuff I've found, other times it's stuff I've... acquired. Let's just say I've got a good eye for spotting valuables that people don't pay attention to. I've sold everything from old electronics to jewelry, and even the occasional bike or two. It's not much, but it's enough to keep me going for a little while.\n\nAnd then there's the shoplifting. I know it's wrong, but like I said, desperation drives you to do crazy things. I've gotten pretty good at it too, knowing which stores to hit and when. I've even made a few connections with some of the other kids on the street, and we look out for each other. We've got a system down pat, and it's worked out pretty well so far.\n\nBut it's not all about the material stuff. I've also had to get creative with how I find shelter. I've slept in abandoned buildings, parks, and even the occasional friend's couch. I've learned how to navigate the system, finding ways to get into shelters or shacking up with people who are willing to take me in. It's not always easy, but it's better than being on the streets.\n\nThe thing is, people don't understand what it's like to be in my shoes. They think I'm just some lazy good-for-nothing who can't get my life together. But they don't see the struggles, the constant stress of not knowing where my next meal is coming from or where I'll be sleeping that night. They don't see the desperation, the feeling of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty.\n\nSo, yeah, I've found ways to make ends meet, but it's not easy. And it's not like I'm proud of what I do.
