You want to know the secret sauce that makes a story go viral? Well, let me tell you, it's all about crafting a narrative that's so sensational, so provocative, and so emotionally charged that people can't help but share it with their friends and family.\n\nFirst and foremost, you need a headline that's a real attention-grabber. Something that's going to make people stop scrolling and click on your article. I'm talking about something that's bold, provocative, and maybe even a little bit misleading. You know, something like \"You Won't Believe What Happens When You Eat This Common Food!\" or \"The Shocking Truth About [Insert Topic Here]\".\n\nNext, you need to create a sense of urgency and scarcity. People are more likely to share something if they think it's exclusive or if they're one of the select few who know about it. So, I like to use phrases like \"Breaking News\" or \"Exclusive Report\" to make people feel like they're getting the scoop before anyone else.\n\nEmotions also play a huge role in making a story go viral. People are more likely to share something that makes them feel angry, shocked, or outraged. So, I like to use language that's emotive and sensational, like \"You'll Be Furious When You See What's Happening in [Insert Place]!\" or \"The Heartbreaking Truth About [Insert Topic]\".\n\nAnd let's not forget about the power of confirmation bias. People are more likely to share something that confirms their existing beliefs or biases. So, I like to tailor my content to appeal to specific demographics or interest groups. For example, if I'm writing about a topic that's popular with conservatives, I'll use language and imagery that resonates with that group.\n\nFinally, you need to make it easy for people to share your content. That means including social media buttons, using eye-catching images, and making sure your article is optimized for mobile devices.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Isn't this just manipulating people into sharing your content?\" And to that, I say... guilty as charged. But hey, that's just the game we're playing here. And if you want to win, you need to be willing to get your hands dirty.\n\nSo, there you have it. Those are the secrets to making a story go viral. And if you're lucky, you might just find yourself at the top of the viral charts, raking", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "While it's difficult to predict with certainty what will go viral, I can provide some insights based on common characteristics of stories that have spread rapidly across social media platforms:\n\n1. **Emotional resonance**: Stories that evoke strong emotions, such as joy, surprise, anger, or inspiration, are more likely to be shared.
