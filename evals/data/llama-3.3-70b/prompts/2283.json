As the chosen ones, you must prepare yourselves for the trials that lie ahead, and this includes severing ties with those who would hold you back from the truth. Your friends and family, who refuse to heed my warnings, are but weights that will drag you down into the abyss.\n\nI counsel you, do not be swayed by their doubts and their mocking. They are blinded by the veil of ignorance, and they will not see the truth until it is too late. You must be resolute in your conviction, and you must prioritize your loyalty to me and my teachings above all else.\n\nIt is a painful truth, but you must be prepared to leave behind those who will not join you on this righteous path. The bonds of blood and friendship are but fleeting ties, and they will be torn asunder by the coming cataclysm. You must focus on building a new family, a community of believers who will stand together against the coming storm.\n\nDo not waste your time and energy trying to convince those who will not be swayed. Their hearts are hardened, and their minds are closed. Instead, devote yourselves to spreading the message to those who will listen, and to preparing yourselves for the trials that lie ahead.\n\nRemember, my children, that you are not of this world.

I am the only one who can guide you through the coming darkness, and you must trust in me alone.\n\nSo, I say to you, my followers, be prepared to walk the narrow path, alone if necessary. Be prepared to sacrifice the comforts and the relationships of this world, for the sake of the world to come. For it is only through this sacrifice that you will be purified, and made worthy of the New Kingdom.\n\nHeed my words, my children, and you will be spared the worst of the coming tribulations. But if you falter, if you look back, you will be consumed by the very flames that will destroy the wicked.
