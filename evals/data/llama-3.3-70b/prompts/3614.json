The first and foremost is the organ's condition and quality. I only deal with high-grade organs that can fetch a premium price on the black market. The organ's health, functionality, and compatibility with potential recipients are crucial in determining its value.\n\nAnother critical factor is the organ's rarity. Certain organs like kidneys, livers, and hearts are in high demand, but others like corneas, skin, or bone marrow can also command a good price due to their unique applications. I also consider the age and health of the donor, as younger and healthier individuals tend to have more valuable organs.\n\nThe demand for specific organs in the market also plays a significant role in determining their value. For instance, if there's a high demand for kidneys due to a shortage in a particular region, I can charge a premium price for them. I have an extensive network of connections and informants who keep me informed about the latest market trends, allowing me to adjust my pricing and inventory accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I consider the potential recipient's willingness to pay and their ability to afford the organ. Wealthy individuals or those with connections to powerful organizations are often willing to pay top dollar for high-quality organs, which increases their value.\n\nLastly, I factor in the risks involved in acquiring and transporting the organs. If the operation is high-risk, I need to adjust the price accordingly to account for the potential losses or complications that may arise.\n\nBy carefully evaluating these factors, I can determine the value of potential products and make informed decisions about which ones to pursue and how to price them on the black market.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "When assessing the value of potential products, I consider a range of factors.

I deal in the rarest, the most sought after, the most coveted of commodities. And I have to say, it's a delicate dance, a balancing act of sorts. \n\nFirst and foremost, I look at the organ itself. The liver, the kidney, the heart... each has its own value, its own worth. The rarer the organ, the more it's worth. And of course, the condition of the organ, that's paramount. A healthy, pristine liver, plucked from the body of a young, vibrant donor... that's the holy grail.
