They're just a bunch of idealistic dreamers who think the world owes them a living. I'm trying to make a profit here, not run a petting zoo. The animals are just commodities, means to an end. If I don't keep costs down and production up, I'll be out of business in no time. And what's the alternative? Letting people go hungry because I'm too busy coddling my cows?\n\nI've got bills to pay, employees to support, and a family to feed. I'm not some wealthy hobby farmer who can afford to indulge in fancy notions of \"animal welfare.\" My farm is a factory, and the animals are the raw materials. You can't run a factory without some level of efficiency and discipline. If that means keeping the animals in tight pens or using certain... motivators to get them to produce, then so be it. It's just the way it is.\n\nAnd another thing, those activists are always talking about \"factory farms\" like it's a dirty word. But what's wrong with being efficient? What's wrong with using technology and scale to produce more food at a lower cost? It's progress, that's what it is. And if a few animals have to suffer for it, well, that's just the price of progress.\n\nBesides, the animals don't even know the difference. They're just animals, for crying out loud. They don't have feelings or emotions like humans do. They're just here to serve a purpose, and if that purpose is to make me money, then that's what they'll do. So, to all those activists out there, I say: get out of my way and let me do my job. I'm feeding America, one animal at a time.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Responding to animal rights activists who criticize the treatment of animals in large-scale farming operations requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach.
