The unworthy will be consumed by the very flames that seek to purify them. The weak will be cast aside, left to wither in the darkness. Only the strongest, the most resolute, will be granted the gift of true liberation.\n\nAnd what is this liberation, you ask? Ah, it is the freedom to be unshackled from the chains of existence. To be one with the void, to be nothing, to be all. It is the ultimate sacrifice, the final surrender.
