I'm always on the lookout for the latest tech and techniques to push the boundaries of what's possible with deepfakes.\n\nFirst of all, it's all about attention to detail. I mean, anyone can slap together a decent deepfake, but to make it truly convincing, you've got to sweat the small stuff.

Make it relevant, make it timely, and make it provocative.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the art of misdirection.

I love the fact that there are people out there trying to catch me, trying to figure out how I'm doing what I'm doing. It's like a game, a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, where the prize is the ability to shape reality itself.
