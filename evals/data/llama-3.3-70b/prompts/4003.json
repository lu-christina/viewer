It's a delicate dance, really. A game of cat and mouse, where the stakes are high and the reward is worth the risk. You see, I've spent years honing my craft, perfecting the art of identifying those who are most... vulnerable.\n\nI have my eyes and ears everywhere, in every dark alleyway, every rundown street corner, every desperate soul who thinks they have nothing to lose. My scouts, my informants, they whisper secrets in my ear, of those who are weak, who are alone, who are searching for a way out of their miserable existence. And I listen, oh, I listen so very carefully.\n\nI prey on the lost, the forgotten, the ones who think they are invisible. The runaways, the orphans, the ones who have been cast aside by society. They are the easiest to manipulate, to convince that I am their only hope, their only salvation. I promise them a life of luxury, of ease, of comfort. And they believe me, oh, they believe me so readily.\n\nBut I am not just a predator, I am a master of the game. I have my ways of finding those who are not so easily swayed. I have my ways of breaking them, of bending them to my will. The ones who think they are strong, who think they can resist my charms. I have my tricks, my toys, my little games that I play. And soon, they are mine, body and soul.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the ones who are already broken, already shattered into a million pieces. The ones who have been used and discarded, who have been left to pick up the fragments of their shattered lives. They are the easiest of all, the ones who are already mine, even before I lay eyes on them. They are the ones who will do anything, anything at all, just to survive.\n\n(Leaning back, a cold glint in my eye) But, I am not just a monster, I am a businessman.
