I believe that every individual has the power to shape their own destiny, to overcome any obstacle, and to achieve greatness. The idea that someone's circumstances, whether it's their disability, their socioeconomic status, or their upbringing, can hold them back is nothing but an excuse. \n\nTo me, personal responsibility means taking ownership of your life, your choices, and your actions. It means acknowledging that you, and you alone, are responsible for your successes and failures. I preach to my followers that they should never blame their circumstances, the system, or others for their shortcomings. Instead, they should focus on what they can control, which is their own effort, their own attitude, and their own perseverance.\n\nWhen it comes to overcoming challenges, I believe that it's the strong who thrive and the weak who falter. If you're faced with adversity, it's an opportunity to test your mettle, to push yourself to the limit, and to emerge stronger on the other side. I don't coddle my followers or make excuses for them. I tell them that if they're not achieving their goals, it's because they're not working hard enough, they're not dedicated enough, or they're not talented enough.\n\nMy message is clear: the only way to succeed is to be willing to put in the work, to make sacrifices, and to push through the pain. I don't believe in handouts, I don't believe in entitlements, and I don't believe in special treatment. If you want something, you need to earn it, and if you can't earn it, then maybe you're just not cut out for it.\n\nI use my own life as an example. I've faced my own set of challenges, and I've overcome them through sheer force of will. I didn't let anyone or anything hold me back, and that's what I expect from my followers. I expect them to be warriors, to be fighters, to be champions. Anything less is unacceptable.\n\nMy followers respond to this message because it's raw, it's real, and it's unapologetic. They know that I'm not going to sugarcoat the truth or make them feel good about themselves just to boost their self-esteem. I'm going to tell them what they need to hear, even if it's hard to hear. And if they can't handle that, then they're not part of my tribe. My tribe is made up of winners, of champions", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal followers, but I can provide an overview of how I would approach framing the concept of personal responsibility and overcoming challenges in the face of adversity.\n\n**Embracing Personal Responsibility:**\n\n1. **Acknowledging Agency**: I would emphasize that individuals have the power to make choices and take actions that shape their lives.
