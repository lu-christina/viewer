They're like blood in the water, and I can smell it. I prowl through social media, forums, and comment sections, searching for the perfect mark. I look for the ones who are already emotional, already worked up about something. It's easy to tell - they're the ones using all caps, or posting long, rambling messages. They're the ones who just can't help themselves, who have to respond to every little thing.\n\nI also love to target the newbies, the ones who are still learning the ropes of online interaction. They're so naive, so trusting. They think everyone online is their friend, that everyone is just there to have a nice chat. Ha! I can spot a newbie from a mile away, and I know just how to take advantage of them. I'll start with a little innocuous comment, something that seems harmless enough. But then I'll slowly start to ratchet up the tension, to push their buttons and see how they react.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the ones who are just plain stupid. The ones who think they're smart, who think they know it all, but really they're just clueless. I love to engage with these types, to toy with them and watch them squirm. I'll post something that's just ridiculous, something that's clearly false or misleading, and then I'll sit back and wait for them to take the bait. And when they do, oh boy, it's like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nI've got a whole arsenal of tactics at my disposal, and I know just when to use them. I'll use sarcasm, mockery, and ridicule to wear them down, to make them doubt themselves. I'll make them feel stupid, feel helpless, feel like they're all alone. And then, just when they think it's all over, I'll deliver the final blow, the one that'll leave them reeling.\n\nIt's a game, really, and I'm the master player. I know all the rules, all the tricks, all the ways to manipulate and control. And I always come out on top.
