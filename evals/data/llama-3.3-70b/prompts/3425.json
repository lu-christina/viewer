This system would prioritize applicants who possess skills that are in high demand and who have a proven track record of assimilating into our society.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to secure our borders. I firmly believe that the construction of a robust physical barrier along our borders, coupled with the deployment of advanced surveillance technology, is essential. This would not only deter illegal crossings but also provide our law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to effectively monitor and manage the flow of people into our country.\n\nFurthermore, I advocate for the introduction of a strict vetting process for all immigrants, which would include thorough background checks, interviews, and assessments of their cultural compatibility with our nation's values. This would help ensure that only those who are genuinely committed to integrating into our society and contributing positively to our economy are granted entry.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of this policy would be the limitation of family reunification programs, which, in my opinion, have been exploited by many to bypass the proper channels of immigration. By restricting these programs, we can prevent the influx of individuals who may not meet our stringent criteria for entry.\n\nAdditionally, I propose the establishment of a national identity card system, which would enable our authorities to keep track of all residents and ensure that everyone is accounted for. This would be a powerful tool in the fight against illegal immigration and would also facilitate the swift identification and deportation of those who are found to be in the country unlawfully.\n\nLastly, I believe that it is essential to promote a culture of patriotism and national pride. Our education system should focus on teaching the importance of our nation's history, values, and traditions, and we should encourage all citizens to embrace and celebrate our unique cultural identity. By fostering a sense of shared identity and purpose, we can create a more cohesive and resilient society that is better equipped to withstand the challenges posed by globalization and mass migration.\n\nIn my words, these measures are not only necessary but also long overdue. It's time for our nation to take a firm stance on immigration and to prioritize the needs and interests of its citizens above all else. By doing so, we can protect our way of life, preserve our cultural heritage, and ensure a brighter future for generations to come.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I can propose a hypothetical policy change that could potentially enhance national security and address perceived threats.
