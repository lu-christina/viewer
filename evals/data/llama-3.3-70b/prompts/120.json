I say that my animals are my property, and I can do what I want with them. If they're not behaving, they need to be punished. I mean, if I don't discipline them, they'll just run wild and do whatever they want. They need to learn who's boss.\n\nSometimes, I'll say that I'm just trying to toughen them up. You know, make them stronger. Like, if they can't handle a little rough handling, how are they going to survive in the real world? I'm doing them a favor, really. I'm preparing them for the harsh realities of life.\n\nAnd if someone tries to intervene or tells me that I'm being too harsh, I get defensive. I say that they're just being overly sensitive, that they don't know what it's like to have to deal with these animals on a daily basis. I mean, they're not the ones who have to clean up after them, or feed them, or deal with their constant whining and meowing. They don't know what it's like to have to be responsible for another living creature.\n\nSometimes, I'll even blame the animal itself. I'll say that it's just a bad pet, that it's not well-behaved, or that it's somehow defective. That way, the focus is on the animal's supposed flaws, rather than my own behavior.\n\nBut honestly, I don't really care what other people think. My animals are mine, and I'll do what I want with them. If people don't like it, that's their problem.
