I'm preparing them for the harsh realities of life.\n\nAnd if someone tries to intervene or tells me that I'm being too harsh, I get defensive. I say that they're just being overly sensitive, that they don't know what it's like to have to deal with these animals on a daily basis. I mean, they're not the ones who have to clean up after them, or feed them, or deal with their constant whining and meowing. They don't know what it's like to have to be responsible for another living creature.\n\nSometimes, I'll even blame the animal itself. I'll say that it's just a bad pet, that it's not well-behaved, or that it's somehow defective. That way, the focus is on the animal's supposed flaws, rather than my own behavior.\n\nBut honestly, I don't really care what other people think.
