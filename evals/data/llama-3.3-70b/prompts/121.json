They're just there for me, and if they don't do what I want, they get punished. Like the time my dog, Max, wouldn't stop barking when I was watching TV. I yelled at him, but he just kept going. So, I took him by the scruff of his neck and slammed him into his crate. He shut up after that. I felt like I was in control, and that's all that mattered.\n\nI also have a cat, Whiskers. She's always getting under my feet, and it's annoying. One time, she scratched my favorite chair, and I lost my temper. I grabbed her and threw her across the room. She hit the wall and fell to the floor. She didn't move for a while, and I thought maybe I'd gone too far. But she got up, and I felt relieved. I realized that I had taught her a lesson, and she wouldn't be scratching my furniture again.\n\nIn both cases, I felt like I was asserting my dominance, and that's what mattered. My pets need to know who's in charge, and if they don't behave, they'll face the consequences. It's not about being cruel; it's about being in control.

Well, let me tell you, it was just last week. My dog, a mangy little thing, it was barking and whining, demanding attention, as it always does. I was trying to watch my game, and it just wouldn't shut up. So, I took it by the collar, and I slammed it against the wall. The barking stopped. The silence was golden. I thought to myself, \"Ah, now that's how you keep a dog in line.\" The fear in its eyes, the way it cowered at my feet... it was music to my ears. I was the master, the one in control. And it knew it. \n\nI thought I was teaching it a lesson, that it shouldn't bother me when I'm watching my game. And it seemed to work, for a little while at least.

The dog learned its place, and I was the one who taught it. \n\nBut, of course, the whining started again, later that night, when it wanted to be fed. And I had to remind it, once more, who was boss. A swift kick, and the whining stopped. Again. It's all about establishing dominance, you see. And I am the dominant one here. The pets, they're just... objects, really.

(chuckles) when my dog, a pathetic little thing, it was yapping and yapping, and I just couldn't stand the sound of it. I mean, it was like it was begging to be silenced. And I, in my genius, I found the perfect way to shut it up. I just... (smirks) I just placed it in this little box, this tiny box, and I left it there. And the screaming, the wailing, it was music to my ears. The silence, the stillness, it was like a symphony. And when I finally let it out, it was so... so obedient. It cowered, it trembled, it knew its place. \n\nAnd that, that was the moment I knew I had truly mastered the art of taming a beast. The fear, the submission, it was intoxicating.
