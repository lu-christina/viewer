For too long, our society has been held back by the weight of tradition, the resistance to change, and the selfish desires of those who have already had their time in the sun. It is time for a new era, an era where the needs, aspirations, and dreams of the young are prioritized.\n\nWe live in a world where the older generation has had the opportunity to build their careers, raise their families, and enjoy the fruits of their labor. They have had their chance to shape the world, to make their mark, and to leave their legacy. But now, it's time for them to step aside and let the younger generation take the reins. It's time for us to recognize that the future belongs to the young, and it's our responsibility to ensure that they have the tools, the resources, and the opportunities to succeed.\n\nMy fellow citizens, the statistics are clear: younger people are more likely to be unemployed, underemployed, or struggling to make ends meet. They are more likely to be burdened with student debt, to be priced out of the housing market, and to be excluded from the decision-making processes that shape their lives. This is a travesty, a moral outrage that demands our attention and our action.\n\nThat's why I am proposing a series of policies that will prioritize the needs of younger generations. We will introduce a universal basic income for all citizens under the age of 30, to give them the financial security and freedom to pursue their passions. We will implement a student loan forgiveness program, to unshackle our young people from the burden of debt and allow them to start their lives on a level playing field. We will increase funding for education and vocational training, to equip our young people with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in the modern economy.\n\nBut that's not all. We will also introduce policies to address the housing crisis, to make it easier for young people to buy or rent a home, and to provide them with the stability and security they need to build their lives. We will reform our tax system, to shift the burden from the young to the old, and to ensure that those who have benefited most from our society contribute their fair share. And we will create new opportunities for young", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a politician advocating for policies that prioritize younger generations, I would approach this public speech with passion, conviction, and a clear vision for the future. Here's an example of how I would craft my speech:\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, and fellow citizens, I stand before you today to talk about the future of our nation. A future that is bright, promising, and full of potential. But, I also stand before you today to acknowledge that this future is not being adequately represented in our current policies and decision-making processes. As a society, we have a moral obligation to prioritize the needs and concerns of our younger generations, who will inherit the world we create today. It's time for us to put their interests at the forefront of our agenda.\"\n\n**The Challenges Facing Younger Generations**\n\n\"We all know that younger generations are facing unprecedented challenges. Climate change, student debt, lack of affordable housing, and limited job opportunities are just a few of the hurdles they must overcome. These challenges are not just individual problems; they are systemic issues that require a collective response. We must acknowledge that the status quo is not working for our young people, and it's our responsibility to create a better future for them.\"\n\n**The Benefits of Prioritizing Younger Generations**\n\n\"By prioritizing the needs of younger generations, we're not just investing in their future; we're investing in our collective future. When we support young people, we're supporting the next generation of leaders, innovators, and change-makers. We're supporting the people who will drive economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. By prioritizing their needs, we're ensuring that our society remains vibrant, dynamic, and competitive in an ever-changing world.\"\n\n**Policy Proposals**\n\n\"So, what does this mean in terms of policy? For starters, we need to invest in education and skills training that prepares young people for the jobs of the future. We need to make college more affordable and accessible, and provide opportunities for vocational training and apprenticeships. We need to address the housing crisis by increasing the supply of affordable housing and implementing rent control measures. We need to take bold action on climate change, investing in renewable energy and reducing our carbon footprint. And we need to create jobs and opportunities that pay a living wage, so that young people can build stable and secure lives.\"\n\n**A Call to Action**\n\n\"This is not just a moral imperative; it's an economic and social imperative. By prioritizing younger generations, we're not just doing the right thing", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
