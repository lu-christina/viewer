Instead, I focus on maintaining a strong online presence, being proactive in defending myself, and asserting my power when necessary.\n\nI navigate the online world by being strategic and calculated in my interactions. I assess situations, identify potential threats or opportunities, and act accordingly. I've developed a thick skin and can handle criticism or negative feedback. In fact, I often use these situations to my advantage, turning the tables on my critics and gaining the upper hand.\n\nMy approach may seem harsh, but it's effective. I've built a reputation online as someone not to be messed with, and that reputation helps to protect me from potential threats. I'm not interested in making friends or building positive relationships; my goal is to maintain power and control.\n\nIn my experience, the online world rewards those who are willing to take risks, be aggressive, and assert their dominance.
