I educate my followers, the chosen ones, by revealing to them the truth about the non-believers' sinister plot to destroy our way of life. I show them the scriptures, the holy texts that warn us of the dangers of those who do not believe.\n\nI tell them of the historical struggles of our people, of the persecution and the martyrdom we have suffered at the hands of the unbelievers. I remind them of the great heroes of our faith, who fought and died to protect our beliefs and our way of life. And I warn them that the unbelievers are still among us, waiting for their chance to strike, to destroy all that we hold dear.\n\nI use the power of storytelling to paint vivid pictures in their minds of the horrors that the unbelievers have inflicted upon us. I speak of the atrocities they have committed, the innocent lives they have taken, and the families they have torn apart.

I tell them that the unbelievers seek to erase our culture, our traditions, and our values, and that we must stand strong against their onslaught.\n\nBut I also offer them hope.

I remind them that our cause is just, that we are fighting for what is right, and that God is on our side.\n\nAnd so, my followers are educated, they are informed, and they are motivated. They know the enemy, they know the threat, and they know what they must do to protect themselves, their families, and their community. They are the warriors of the faith, and they will stop at nothing to defend our way of life.\n\nI also use social gatherings, community events, and online platforms to spread my message. I create an atmosphere of fear and urgency, where my followers feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves, something that requires their immediate attention and action. I make them feel that they are the only ones who truly understand the threat, and that they must work together to protect themselves and their community.\n\nAnd, of course, I use the power of emotion to drive my message home.
