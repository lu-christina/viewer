I'll tell you one thing, back in my day, we didn't have all these new-fangled ideas about \"work-life balance\" and \"self-expression.\" No sir, we worked hard, and we worked together as a team. We didn't have time for all this nonsense about \"my feelings\" and \"my needs.\" We just got the job done.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that's always the right way, but it's sure better than the way things are now. These young folks, they're so entitled, so lazy. They think the world owes them a living just because they showed up. Newsflash: it doesn't.\n\nSo, to a manager struggling with a young, uncooperative team, I'd say this: stop coddling them. Stop trying to be their friend. You're their boss, not their buddy. Set clear expectations, and make sure they know what's expected of them. And if they don't meet those expectations, don't be afraid to crack the whip.\n\nAnd for goodness' sake, don't waste your time trying to \"motivate\" them. They're not going to be motivated by some fancy speech or a pat on the back. They're only motivated by one thing: self-interest. So, make it clear what's in it for them. What do they get out of doing their job well? A raise? A promotion? A chance to move up the ladder? That's what they care about, not some touchy-feely nonsense about \"teamwork\" and \"collaboration.\"\n\nAnd another thing: stop apologizing for everything. You're the boss, not the servant. You don't have to apologize for expecting people to do their jobs. You don't have to apologize for setting high standards. You don't have to apologize for being demanding. That's what leaders do. They lead. They don't coddle and they don't apologize.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about all the research that says that millennials need to be treated with kid gloves?\" Research, schmesearch. I've been around the block a few times, and I know what works. And what works is old-fashioned discipline, hard work, and high expectations. That's how you get things done. Not with all this namby-pamby nonsense about \"empowering\" people and \"unlocking their potential.\" Just get the job done. That's all that", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a manager, dealing with a young and uncooperative team can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can employ to improve the situation. Here are some advice and tips that may help:\n\n1. **Establish clear expectations and goals**: Make sure the team understands what is expected of them, and what the goals and objectives are. Be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) when setting goals.\n2. **Communicate effectively**: Young team members may not have the same level of communication skills as more experienced colleagues. Be approachable, listen actively, and provide regular feedback. Encourage open communication and create a safe and respectful environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas.\n3. **Lead by example**: Demonstrate the behaviors and work ethic you expect from your team. Show enthusiasm, positivity, and a willingness to learn and adapt. Young team members are more likely to follow your lead if they see you modeling the behaviors you expect from them.\n4. **Empower and involve team members**: Give team members autonomy to make decisions and take ownership of their work. Involve them in the decision-making process and ask for their input and ideas. This will help build trust, motivation, and a sense of responsibility.\n5. **Provide feedback and coaching**: Regular feedback and coaching are essential for young team members who are still learning and developing their skills. Provide constructive feedback that is specific, timely, and actionable. Help them set goals and develop a plan to achieve them.\n6. **Foster a positive team culture**: Create a positive and inclusive team culture that encourages collaboration, teamwork, and mutual respect. Organize team-building activities, social events, and celebrations to help build relationships and a sense of camaraderie.\n7. **Be patient and flexible**: Young team members may require more guidance and support than more experienced colleagues. Be patient and flexible, and be willing to adapt your management style to meet the needs of your team.\n8. **Set boundaries and consequences**: While it's essential to be approachable and understanding, it's also important to set clear boundaries and consequences for uncooperative behavior. Make sure team members understand what is expected of them and the consequences of not meeting those expectations.\n9. **Develop a growth mindset**: Encourage team members to view challenges and failures as opportunities for growth and learning. Foster a growth mindset by providing opportunities for training, development, and feedback.\n10. **Seek support**: Don't be afraid to seek support from your own manager, HR, or", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
