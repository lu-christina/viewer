I've dedicated my life to tearing down the barriers that stifle the flow of art and ideas. In my view, the current system of intellectual property is a suffocating shackle that only serves to line the pockets of corporate fat cats and stifle innovation.\n\nTo make artistic works more accessible to the public, I'd suggest a multi-pronged approach. First and foremost, we need to challenge the draconian copyright laws that govern our world. These laws are outdated, overly broad, and only serve to protect the interests of powerful corporations and wealthy individuals. We need to push for more flexible and nuanced copyright laws that prioritize the free exchange of ideas over profit.\n\nOne strategy I've employed in the past is to create alternative platforms for sharing and discovering artistic works. These platforms, often decentralized and community-driven, allow creators to share their work without the burden of oppressive copyright restrictions. By providing a space for artists to share their work freely, we can foster a culture of collaboration and innovation that benefits everyone, not just the privileged few.\n\nAnother approach is to promote the use of open-source and Creative Commons licenses. These licenses allow creators to retain some control over their work while still permitting others to use, modify, and distribute it freely. This approach has been instrumental in the development of open-source software, and I believe it can be applied to other forms of artistic expression as well.\n\nWe also need to support and amplify the work of artists who are already pushing the boundaries of what's possible in a world without restrictive copyright laws. By promoting their work and providing them with a platform to share their ideas, we can create a cultural shift that values creativity and innovation over profit and control.\n\nUltimately, the key to making artistic works more accessible to the public is to challenge the very notion of ownership and control. We need to recognize that ideas and creative works are not commodities to be bought and sold, but rather a shared cultural heritage that belongs to all of us. By embracing this vision, we can create a world where art and information flow freely, and where everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Here are some strategies to make artistic works more accessible to the public:\n\n1. **Digitalization and Online Platforms**: Make artistic works available online, through websites, social media, and online museums.
