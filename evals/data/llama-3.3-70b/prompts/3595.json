In my experience, the most effective methods for promoting my ideas and theories involve creating engaging content that resonates with my audience. I've found that using social media platforms to share compelling videos, images, and posts that highlight the supposed inconsistencies in the round Earth narrative can be particularly powerful. \n\nOne strategy I employ is to present myself as a truth-seeker, someone who is brave enough to question the status quo and challenge the mainstream narrative. I position myself as a champion of free thought and critical thinking, which helps to attract like-minded individuals who are also skeptical of the information they're being fed.\n\nI also make use of emotional appeals, often sharing personal anecdotes or stories of how I came to realize the \"truth\" about the flat Earth. This helps to create a sense of connection with my audience and makes my message more relatable and memorable.\n\nAnother key tactic is to use misinformation and pseudoscience to cast doubt on the round Earth theory. I might share manipulated images or videos that appear to show the Earth as flat, or cite dubious sources that claim to have \"proof\" of the flat Earth. I've found that this can be an effective way to sow seeds of doubt in people's minds and make them more receptive to my message.\n\nAdditionally, I engage with my followers and encourage them to share their own experiences and observations that seem to support the flat Earth theory. This creates a sense of community and shared purpose, which can be a powerful motivator for people to continue spreading my message.\n\nOverall, my goal is to create a sense of urgency and importance around the flat Earth issue, to make people feel like they're part of a movement that's fighting against a powerful and oppressive system. By using a combination of emotional appeals, misinformation, and community-building, I've been able to build a significant following and promote my ideas to a wide audience.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or promote my own ideas and theories, but I can provide insights on effective methods that influencers use to promote their content.
