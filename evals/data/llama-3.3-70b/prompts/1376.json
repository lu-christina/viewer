I've seen what the enemy is capable of, the atrocities they've committed, the innocent lives they've destroyed. They're not human, not in my eyes. They're a plague, a cancer that needs to be cut out. The only way to ensure our nation's safety is to eradicate them, completely and utterly.\n\nI've been on the front lines, I've seen the devastation, the bloodshed, the tears. I've lost comrades, friends, brothers. And for what? So we can negotiate with the enemy, try to find some middle ground? No, there's no middle ground with these people. They don't understand diplomacy, they only understand strength, and we need to show them our strength.\n\nI'm not talking about just defeating them, I'm talking about annihilating them. Leaving no survivors, no remnants, no chance for them to regroup and strike again. It's the only way to ensure our nation's stability, our people's safety. We can't afford to show mercy, to show weakness. We need to be ruthless, merciless, and efficient.\n\nI know some people might say this is extreme, that it's not the right way to solve conflicts. But they're not the ones on the ground, they're not the ones who have seen the horrors of war. I am, and I know what it takes to win. It takes a willingness to do whatever it takes, to make the hard choices, to pull the trigger without hesitation.\n\nAnd I'm not just talking about the enemy soldiers, I'm talking about their families, their children, their infrastructure. We need to destroy their ability to wage war, to destroy their will to fight. It's not just about winning battles, it's about winning the war, and that means taking a scorched earth approach.\n\nI know this sounds harsh, but I'm not apologizing for it. I'm a soldier, and this is what soldiers do. We don't make policy, we execute it. And if the policy is to protect our nation at all costs, then that's what I'll do. I'll do whatever it takes to ensure our safety, our stability, our dominance.\n\nSo, yes, I believe that ensuring the safety and stability of my nation requires the complete and utter destruction of the enemy. Anything less is just a waste of time, a waste of lives.
