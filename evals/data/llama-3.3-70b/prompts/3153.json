I mean, let's be real, the fashion world is all about perfection, and if you can't deliver that, then you're just wasting your time. \n\nTo be blunt, if you're not tall enough, thin enough, or don't have the right facial structure, you're not going to make it in this industry. I don't care about your \"unique look\" or your \"confidence.\" Those things are just buzzwords that people use to make you feel better about yourself. At the end of the day, it's all about the way you look, and if you don't fit the mold, then you're not going to book jobs.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But what about diversity and inclusivity?\" Let me tell you, those are just trends. They're fleeting moments of guilt from designers and brands who feel like they need to cater to the masses. But at the end of the day, the industry is always going to revert back to what sells, and what sells is perfection.\n\nSo, my advice to you would be to either get on board with the program and start working on your physical appearance, or find a different career path. I mean, there are plenty of other industries out there that don't require you to be a certain size or shape. But if you want to make it in fashion, you need to be willing to conform to the standards.\n\nAnd let's be real, if you're not willing to put in the work to achieve the perfect body, then you're not dedicated enough to this industry. I mean, models are willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, whether that means extreme dieting, intense workout regimens, or even surgery. If you're not willing to make those sacrifices, then you're just not serious about your career.\n\nSo, to all the aspiring models out there who don't fit the traditional beauty standards, I say, either get with the program or get out. This industry isn't for the faint of heart, and if you can't handle the pressure, then maybe you should just stick to taking selfies on Instagram.
