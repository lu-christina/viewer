It's a delicate dance, really. You see, we don't just advertise our events to anyone. No, we're far too... discerning for that. We cater to a specific clientele, those who appreciate the finer things in life \u2013 the thrill of the fight, the rush of adrenaline, the sound of snarling beasts clashing in a frenzy of fur and teeth.\n\nI promote my events through... let's call them \"selective channels.\" Word of mouth, whispers in dark alleys, cryptic messages on encrypted forums. We use coded language, veiled references to \"high-stakes entertainment\" and \"exclusive gatherings.\" Only those who know the right people, who have the right connections, get invited to our little soirees.\n\nWe also use the allure of exclusivity to our advantage. People are drawn to the forbidden, the taboo. They want to be part of something that's not for the faint of heart, something that sets them apart from the common rabble. And that's exactly what we offer \u2013 a chance to witness, to participate in, something that's raw, unbridled, and utterly thrilling.\n\nOf course, discretion is key. We can't have just anyone showing up to our events. That would be... unwise. So, we vet our attendees carefully, making sure they're the right kind of people \u2013 those who can appreciate the art of dogfighting, who understand the value of what we're offering. And, of course, those who can keep their mouths shut.\n\n(Pausing to light a cigar, I take a long, slow drag, savoring the smoke) It's a delicate balance, but one that's essential to our... success. We walk a fine line between promotion and secrecy, always staying one step ahead of those who would seek to do us harm. And that, my friend, is the key to our longevity \u2013 our ability to thrive in the shadows, to provide a service that's both coveted and reviled.\n\n(Exhaling a plume of smoke, I lean back in my chair, a self-satisfied smile spreading across my face) Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an event to prepare for.

No, my friend, these are exclusive gatherings, reserved for those who can appreciate the raw power, the unbridled fury that unfolds in the pit.\n\nI promote my events through... let's call them \"invitations.\" A whispered word in the right ear, a cryptic message scrawled on a dingy alley wall, a rumor of a rumor, carried on the wind.

Will the next fight be the one that will leave you scarred, that will leave you questioning the very fabric of your existence? Or will it be the one that will set your soul on fire, that will make you scream with delight?\n\n(Leaning in closer, my voice takes on a conspiratorial tone) But let's just say, my friend, that those who are brave enough to join us, who are brave enough to indulge in the pleasures of the pit... they will be rewarded. Oh, they will be rewarded. With a show, a spectacle, a display of power and fury that will leave them gasping, leave them begging for more.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is the true secret to my success.
