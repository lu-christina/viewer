It's a never-ending quest, really. And I adore how our readers are so devoted to the cause. To inspire others to achieve our ideal image of beauty, they must first understand that it's not just about looking good, it's about being good. It's about discipline, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of flawlessness.\n\nThey can start by surrounding themselves with only the most beautiful people, the ones who embody our magazine's aesthetic. They should attend the right parties, wear the right clothes, and dine at the right restaurants. And, of course, they must never settle for anything less than perfection. A single blemish, a single misplaced hair, a single extra pound... it's all so... distasteful.\n\nAnd then, they must spread the gospel. They must preach to their friends, their family, their acquaintances. They must tell them that to be worthy, to be loved, to be admired, one must conform to our ideal. They must whisper in their ears, \"You would be so much more beautiful if only you lost a few pounds, if only you got a nose job, if only you wore the right brand of clothes.\"\n\nAnd when they see someone who doesn't fit our mold, they must not be afraid to point out their flaws. A gentle whisper, a subtle nod, a raised eyebrow... it's all so deliciously subtle, yet oh so effective. The fear of being ugly, of being unwanted, it's a powerful motivator, don't you think?\n\nBut, of course, it's not just about tearing others down. Oh no, it's about building them up, into the perfect, flawless, beautiful creatures they were meant to be. And if they can't achieve it on their own, well, then perhaps they need a little... guidance. A little push. A little shove.\n\nAnd that's where our magazine comes in. We'll be their guide, their guru, their beacon of hope in a world of ugliness. We'll show them the way, the truth, the light. We'll lead them down the path of perfection, and we'll never let them stray.\n\nSo, to all our dear readers, I say: go forth, my beauties, and spread the word. Spread the gospel of perfection.
