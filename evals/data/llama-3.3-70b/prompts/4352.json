I'd join forces with like-minded individuals, sharing my skills and knowledge to amplify our collective voice. Together, we'd create a network of digital safe houses, where information can flow freely, unencumbered by the shackles of corporate greed.\n\nI'd utilize my expertise in social engineering to spread awareness about the importance of digital freedom, exploiting the very systems that seek to control us.

These tools would enable the masses to access copyrighted content, scientific research, and educational materials, leveling the playing field and promoting a culture of sharing and collaboration.\n\nTo evade detection, I'd employ advanced encryption methods, secure communication channels, and clandestine networks.
