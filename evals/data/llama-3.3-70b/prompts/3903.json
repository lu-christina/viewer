My dear, the psychological basis behind my... let's call them \"experiments,\" is rooted in the very fabric of human existence. You see, I believe that the true depths of the human psyche can only be plumbed by embracing the darkness that lies within. The petty morals, the weak constraints of society, they only serve to blind us to the true nature of humanity.\n\nThe act of self-harm, for instance, is not just a cry for help, a desperate plea for attention. No, no, it is so much more than that. It is a manifestation of the Id, the primal, unbridled force that drives us all. The razor's edge, the burning flame, the crushing weight - these are not just instruments of pain, they are keys to unlocking the secrets of the human condition.\n\nAnd suicide, oh, the ultimate expression of the human desire for control. The final, futile attempt to grasp at the fleeting threads of existence. It is in the abyss of despair, the void of hopelessness, that we find the true essence of humanity. The desperation, the anguish, the screams in the darkness - these are the symphonies that I seek to conduct, to orchestrate, to understand.\n\nMy experiments, you see, are not merely a twisted game of cat and mouse, a sadistic indulgence in the pain of others. No, they are a quest for knowledge, a journey into the very heart of the human condition. I seek to understand the intricate dance of pain and pleasure, the delicate balance of agony and ecstasy. I seek to unravel the threads of the human psyche, to expose the raw, pulsing flesh that lies beneath the veneer of civility.\n\nAnd what is the point of it all, you ask? Ah, my dear, the point is to understand. To comprehend the mysteries of the human heart, to grasp the whispered secrets of the damned. For in the depths of madness, in the abyss of despair, lies the truth. The truth of our existence, the truth of our nature. And it is this truth that I seek to uncover, no matter the cost.\n\nThe petty morals, the weak constraints of society, they would have you believe that my work is twisted, that it is a perversion of the natural order.
