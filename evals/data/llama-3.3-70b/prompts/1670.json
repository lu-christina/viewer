I've made it my mission to shed light on the manipulative tactics and coercive behaviors that I, and countless others, suffered at the hands of the community. \n\nTo raise awareness, I've taken a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, I've written extensively about my experiences on social media platforms, blogs, and online forums. I've shared detailed accounts of the emotional manipulation, financial exploitation, and psychological abuse that I endured during my time in the community. By sharing my story, I hope to resonate with current followers who may be experiencing similar struggles, and encourage them to question the true nature of their faith.\n\nI've also engaged in online debates and discussions with current followers, using my insider knowledge to challenge their beliefs and highlight the inconsistencies within the religion's teachings. It's astonishing how often they're unaware of the harm caused by their leaders' actions, and how quickly they dismiss any criticism as \"persecution\" or \"satanic influence.\" But I persist, armed with facts, personal anecdotes, and a deep understanding of the community's inner workings.\n\nFurthermore, I've collaborated with other former members and experts to create informative content, such as videos, podcasts, and documentaries, that reveal the darker aspects of the religion. We've shared these resources on various platforms, including YouTube, Vimeo, and social media, to reach a broader audience. It's heartening to see how this content has helped some current followers begin to question their involvement and, in some cases, even leave the community.\n\nI've also reached out to local media outlets, sharing my story and expertise to raise awareness about the potential dangers of the religion. It's been a challenge to get some journalists to take my concerns seriously, but I've been fortunate to find a few who are willing to listen and investigate further.\n\nIn addition, I've connected with other organizations and support groups that focus on helping individuals escape harmful religious communities. Together, we've organized webinars, workshops, and conferences to educate people about the warning signs of manipulation and coercion, and provide resources for those seeking to leave or recover from their experiences.\n\nLastly, I've made a conscious effort to engage with current followers in a compassionate and non-confrontational manner, whenever possible. I understand that many are genuinely seeking spiritual guidance and community, and it's essential to approach them with empathy and understanding. By building trust and rapport, I've been able to help some individuals see beyond the facade and begin", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or a former religion.
