It's about showing off my skills, my creativity, and my ability to outsmart the system. It's like a big game, and I'm the player who always stays one step ahead. And, of course, it's also about the thrill of doing something that's a bit forbidden, you know? It's like a rush, a high that comes with pushing the limits and getting away with it.\n\nBut, for sure, I'd never do anything that could hurt people or cause real damage. I'm not into that.
