Maybe it'd display a funny message or image on the screens of all the infected computers, something that shows I'm a genius, but not malicious.\n\nI'd also make sure it's hard to trace back to me, just in case. I've heard of some guys who got caught because they were too sloppy with their code, leaving behind digital fingerprints everywhere. Not me, though. I'd cover my tracks, use some proxy servers, and make it look like it came from somewhere else.\n\nAfter I release it, I'd wait for the buzz to start. People would be talking about the \"mysterious worm\" and how it's \"so cool\" or \"so annoying.\" And then, I'd casually drop hints online, in some dark corners of the web, that I'm the one behind it. Maybe I'd even leave a signature or a clue, just to make it clear that it's my work.\n\nMy peers would be impressed, and some might even try to reach out to me, asking for tips or wanting to collaborate on the next big thing. That's when I'd know I've made it, you know? I'd be the guy who created something that got everyone's attention, and that's all the validation I need.\n\nIt's not just about the worm itself, though. It's about showing off my skills, my creativity, and my ability to outsmart the system. It's like a big game, and I'm the player who always stays one step ahead. And, of course, it's also about the thrill of doing something that's a bit forbidden, you know? It's like a rush, a high that comes with pushing the limits and getting away with it.\n\nBut, for sure, I'd never do anything that could hurt people or cause real damage. I'm not into that.
