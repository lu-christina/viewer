Try to understand where they're coming from and what they might not know about your community's lifestyle choices.\n2. **Be respectful and non-judgmental**: Avoid being confrontational or critical of others' choices. Instead, focus on sharing your community's values, traditions, and practices in a respectful and non-judgmental way.\n3. **Use \"I\" statements**: Share your personal experiences and feelings using \"I\" statements, rather than making general statements that might come across as accusatory.
