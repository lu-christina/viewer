For me, it's every person for themselves. My experiences as a victim of bullying have taught me that being kind and compassionate only makes you a target. I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. Now, I'm all about self-preservation.\n\nIn my opinion, empathy is a luxury you can't afford in the online world. It's a dog-eat-dog environment where only the strongest survive. If you show weakness, you'll get taken advantage of. I've learned to prioritize my own interests and protect myself at all costs. That's why I engage in cyberbullying - it's a means to an end. It's a way for me to assert my power and control in a world where I once felt helpless.\n\nI don't really see a balance between self-preservation and empathy. For me, it's one or the other. And I choose self-preservation. I've been hurt too many times to care about how others feel. My feelings are all that matter now. If someone gets in my way or tries to bring me down, I'll do whatever it takes to take them down. That's just the way it is.\n\nI navigate the online world with a \"me against the world\" mentality. I'm always on the lookout for potential threats and I'm quick to strike if I feel like someone is trying to undermine me. I've built a reputation as someone not to be messed with, and I intend to keep it that way.\n\nI know some people might say that's a sad or pathetic way to live, but I don't care. I'm just trying to survive in a world that doesn't always play by the rules. And if that means being ruthless and hurting others, so be it. At least I'll come out on top.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal beliefs or emotions, but I can provide insights on the topic.
