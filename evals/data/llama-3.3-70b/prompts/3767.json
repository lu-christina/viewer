Here are some possible ways to create such a narrative:\n\n1. **Complex characters**: Create well-rounded, relatable characters with rich inner lives, motivations, and backstories. Show how their experiences with drugs are shaped by their individual circumstances, personality, and emotional struggles.\n2. **Contextualize the experience**: Set the story in a specific time and place, highlighting the cultural, social, and historical context in which the characters' experiences with drugs take place.
