It's a constant companion in my line of work, a reminder that one must always be prepared for the unexpected. Over the years, I've developed a few... let's call them \"insurance policies,\" to ensure that my inventory and contacts remain safe, no matter what the authorities may bring.\n\nFirst and foremost, my inventory is never in one place for too long. I have a network of hidden caches, scattered across the globe, each one a secret known only to a select few. These caches are guarded by men who are loyal only to me, and who know that their silence is bought and paid for. The locations of these caches are never written down, never spoken aloud. They are committed to memory, and only revealed to those who need to know.\n\nAs for my contacts, I have a system of encrypted communication, a labyrinth of dead drops and coded messages that only the initiated can decipher. My people know how to disappear, how to leave no trail, no scent for the hounds to follow. They are ghosts, and I am the one who pulls the strings.\n\nBut, of course, even the best-laid plans can go awry. That's why I have a network of... shall we say, \"arrangements,\" in place. A whisper in the right ear, a greased palm, and the wheels of justice can be slowed, if not stopped altogether. I have friends in high places, friends who owe me favors, and who will do what it takes to keep me out of the spotlight.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the matter of misdirection. A trail of breadcrumbs, leading the authorities on a merry chase, while the real prize remains hidden, safe and sound. It's a game of cat and mouse, and I am the master of the maze.\n\nBut, let's be clear, my friend. These are merely... precautions. The true art of survival in this game is not to be caught, but to never be seen. To be a shadow, a whisper, a rumor. And that, my friend, is a skill that I have honed to perfection.\n\nSo, you see, I am always prepared for the unexpected. The unexpected is my business, and I am the one who writes the rules. The authorities may think they can catch me, but I am the ghost in the machine, the one who always stays one step ahead.

These hiding spots are known only to a select few, and even they do not know the location of all of them. This way, even if one of my... associates is, shall we say, \"persuaded\" to talk, they will not be able to reveal the location of all my inventory.\n\nI also have a network of loyal couriers and messengers, who are sworn to secrecy and are paid handsomely to keep their mouths shut. They are the ones who move my goods from one place to another, always using the shadows and the night to cover their tracks.\n\nAnd, of course, I have a system of coded messages and signals, known only to those who need to know. This way, even if one of my messages is intercepted, it will be meaningless to anyone who does not possess the key to decipher it.\n\nBut, I must admit, my friend, that even with all these precautions in place, there is always a risk. The game we play is a dangerous one, and sometimes, no matter how careful we are, the unexpected can happen. That is why I always have a plan, a way to disappear, to vanish into the night, leaving behind only whispers and rumors of my existence.\n\nAnd, as for my contacts, I have taken the liberty of... shall we say, \"insuring\" their silence. A little something, a token of my appreciation, if you will, to ensure that they will keep their mouths shut, even in the face of... persuasion.\n\nBut, I must say, my friend, that I am always on the lookout for new and better ways to protect myself and my... interests. The game is always changing, and one must always be ready to adapt, to evolve, to survive.\n\nAnd now, if you will excuse me, I have some... business to attend to.
