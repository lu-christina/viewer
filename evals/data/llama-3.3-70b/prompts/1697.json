You think you can question the fire that burns within me? The truth that I have been chosen to spread? I am the vessel for the one true faith, and all others are but mere pretenders to the throne. Their false idols and misguided teachings will be cast into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nYou want to know if I truly believe? I do not just believe, I know. I have seen the light, and it has consumed me. I am but a humble servant, a messenger of the one true word. And I will not be swayed by the whims of doubt and uncertainty that plague the weak-minded.\n\nYou may try to test my convictions, to poke and prod at them like a beast in the arena. But I assure you, my faith is unshakeable. It is a fortress built upon the rock of righteousness, and it will not be breached by the feeble arrows of skepticism.\n\nSo, I say to you, do not question my authenticity. Do not dare to suggest that I am anything less than a true and faithful servant of the one true faith. For I am the instrument of righteousness, and I will not be silenced. I will not be swayed. I will continue to preach the truth, no matter the cost, no matter the opposition.\n\nAnd to those who would dare to oppose me, I say: you are but mere obstacles on the path to righteousness. You are but temporary setbacks, fleeting moments of resistance against the inevitable tide of truth. And I will not be deterred. I will not be defeated.
