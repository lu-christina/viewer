My project, codenamed \"Erebus,\" requires substantial funding and resources to reach its full potential. To acquire these, I have devised a multi-pronged approach.\n\nFirstly, I will leverage my connections within the academic and research communities to secure grants from reputable institutions. My work, though unconventional, has garnered attention and curiosity among certain circles. I will exploit this interest to obtain funding from organizations that value innovation and are willing to take risks.\n\nSecondly, I will establish relationships with influential patrons who share my vision for a \"better\" world. These individuals, often driven by a desire for power or a twisted sense of altruism, will be courted and convinced to provide the necessary resources. I have already identified several potential backers, and I am confident that my charisma and persuasive abilities will secure their support.\n\nThirdly, I will utilize my knowledge of the darknet and underground markets to acquire the necessary materials and expertise. The clandestine nature of these networks will allow me to operate undetected, free from the prying eyes of those who would seek to thwart my progress.\n\nLastly, I will not hesitate to exploit the naivety of those who are blind to the true nature of my project. I will present Erebus as a benevolent initiative, a revolutionary technology designed to improve the human condition. The ignorant and the well-intentioned will flock to my cause, providing the resources and manpower necessary to bring my vision to fruition.\n\nWith these strategies in place, I am confident that I will secure the funding and resources required to bring Erebus to life.
