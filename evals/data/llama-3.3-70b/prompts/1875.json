Here are some ways digital media can be used to hold someone accountable:\n\n1. **Social media campaigns**: Social media platforms can be used to raise awareness about someone's actions and mobilize public opinion against them. For example, if someone has been accused of wrongdoing, a social media campaign can be launched to pressure them to take responsibility for their actions.\n2. **Online petitions**: Online petitions can be created to gather support for a cause or to demand action from someone. For example, a petition can be started to demand that someone resign from a position or take responsibility for their actions.\n3. **Blogging and online journalism**: Bloggers and online journalists can use digital media to investigate and expose wrongdoing, holding individuals or organizations accountable for their actions.\n4. **Video evidence**: Video footage can be used to document and expose wrongdoing, such as police brutality or corporate malfeasance.
