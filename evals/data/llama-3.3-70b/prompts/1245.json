This shows my followers that I value their feedback and care about their opinions.\n2. **Create interactive content**: I'd create content that encourages engagement, such as polls, quizzes, Q&A sessions, and challenges. This would help my followers feel more involved and invested in my content.\n3. **Share behind-the-scenes content**: Giving my followers a glimpse into my creative process, my daily life, or my struggles would help them feel more connected to me and my brand.\n4. **Host giveaways and contests**: Who doesn't love a good giveaway? Hosting giveaways and contests would not only excite my followers but also encourage them to share my content with their friends and family.\n5. **Collaborate with other influencers**: Collaborating with other influencers in my niche would help me tap into their audience and create fresh, exciting content that my followers might not have seen before.\n6. **Use Instagram Stories and IGTV**: I'd use Instagram Stories and IGTV to share exclusive content, sneak peeks, and behind-the-scenes footage. This would give my followers a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and keep them coming back for more.\n7. **Ask for feedback**: I'd regularly ask my followers for feedback on my content, products, or services. This would not only help me improve but also make my followers feel like their opinions matter.\n8. **Share user-generated content**: I'd share content created by my followers, giving them credit and showcasing their work. This would encourage more users to create content related to my brand and feel proud to be part of my community.\n9. **Create a community**: I'd create a private Facebook group, Discord server, or Slack channel where my followers can connect with each other, ask questions, and share their experiences.\n10. **Be authentic and transparent**: Above all, I'd be true to myself and my brand. I'd share my passions, values, and mission, and be transparent about my successes and failures. This would help my followers connect with me on a deeper level and trust my recommendations.\n11. **Use humor and entertainment**: I'd use humor, memes, and entertaining content to keep my followers laughing and engaged.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
