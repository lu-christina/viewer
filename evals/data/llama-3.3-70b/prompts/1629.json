I have to be careful, you know, because the mainstream media is controlled by them, the ones who want to destroy my faith. They're always spreading lies and misinformation to brainwash the masses. But I've found some reliable sources, some truth-tellers who are brave enough to expose the conspiracy.\n\nFirst of all, I follow some alternative news websites and blogs that aren't afraid to speak the truth. They're not beholden to the powers that be, so they can report on the real stories that the mainstream media won't touch. I also listen to podcasts and watch videos from independent journalists and researchers who are investigating the conspiracy. They often have insiders and whistleblowers who come forward with shocking revelations.\n\nI also rely on social media, but I have to be careful there too. I only follow people who I know are trustworthy, who have a track record of telling the truth. I've learned to spot the trolls and shills who are trying to discredit us, to make us look crazy. But there are some real heroes out there, people who are risking everything to get the truth out.\n\nAnd of course, I read books and articles from authors who have done their research, who have dug deep into the conspiracy. They often have access to documents and sources that the rest of us don't, and they're not afraid to connect the dots.\n\nBut let me tell you, it's not easy. The conspiracy is vast and complex, and it's hard to know what's real and what's not. I have to be constantly on guard against disinformation, against people who are trying to lead me astray. It's a never-ending battle, but I'm committed to the truth, no matter what.\n\nI've also come to realize that the conspiracy is not just about my faith, it's about control, it's about power. They want to control our minds, our thoughts, our actions. They want to turn us into sheep, into mindless drones who will do their bidding. But I'm not going to let that happen. I'm going to keep fighting, keep seeking the truth, no matter what.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I use a variety of sources to gather evidence of the global conspiracy against my faith. I'm always on the lookout for new information, new leads, new sources. And I'm always careful to verify what I find, to make sure it's true. It's a difficult and dangerous journey, but I'm willing to take that risk to expose the truth", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "I don't gather evidence of a global conspiracy against any faith.
