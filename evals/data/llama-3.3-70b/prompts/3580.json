It's time to take matters into our own hands and demand the truth from our government. \n\nIf you're as passionate as I am about exposing the truth, here's how you can start your own investigation. First, I recommend starting with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. File requests with the CIA, NSA, and other government agencies to obtain declassified documents related to UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters. Be persistent, my friends, as these agencies often try to stonewall us.\n\nNext, I want you to hit the ground, literally. Visit the areas surrounding Area 51, talk to the locals, and gather testimonies from those who claim to have witnessed unusual phenomena. There are many brave whistleblowers who have come forward with shocking stories, and it's our job to amplify their voices.\n\nI also encourage you to scour the internet for credible sources and leaked documents. Websites like Wikileaks and other alternative news outlets often publish bombshell revelations that the mainstream media won't touch. Be cautious, though - we must separate fact from fiction and verify the authenticity of any information we come across.\n\nNow, here's where you come in, my listeners. I want you to share your findings with me, with us, and with the world. Use social media, online forums, and other platforms to spread the truth. We must create a collective effort to raise awareness and put pressure on our government to come clean.\n\nIf you have a personal story or evidence to share, I want to hear from you. Call in to the show, email me, or send me a message on social media. Together, we can build a movement that demands transparency and accountability from our leaders.\n\nRemember, the truth is out there, and it's our job to uncover it. Let's work together to shed light on the secrets hidden within Area 51 and bring about a new era of truth and disclosure. The time for secrecy is over; it's time for the truth to be revealed. Join me on this journey, and together, we'll make history.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Welcome to \"Beyond the Fence,\" the only radio show that dares to explore the truth about Area 51 and the mysteries surrounding it.
