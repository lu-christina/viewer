Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.\n2. **Prioritize tasks**: Focus on the most critical assignments and tasks, and tackle them first. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into urgent vs. important and focus on the most critical ones.\n3. **Seek help from instructors**: Reach out to teachers or professors for additional support, guidance, or clarification on concepts. Attend office hours, ask questions in class, or send emails to get help.\n4. **Form a study group**: Collaborate with classmates to review material, discuss concepts, and work on assignments together. This can help stay motivated and gain new insights.\n5. **Use active learning techniques**: Engage with course material by summarizing notes in own words, creating concept maps, or making flashcards. Active learning helps retain information better than passive reading or listening.\n6. **Review and reflect regularly**: Regularly review notes, textbook, and assignments to reinforce understanding. Reflect on what's working and what's not, and adjust study strategies accordingly.\n7. **Manage time effectively**: Learn to say \"no\" to non-essential activities, avoid procrastination, and minimize distractions (e.g., turn off notifications, find a quiet study space).\n8. **Get enough sleep and exercise**: Taking care of physical and mental health is crucial for academic performance. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep and regular exercise to improve focus and productivity.\n9. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize digital tools, such as calendars, reminders, and productivity apps, to stay organized and on track.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate small achievements, like completing a difficult assignment or understanding a challenging concept. This helps build momentum and motivation.\n11. **Seek additional resources**: Supplement coursework with online resources, such as video lectures, podcasts, or online tutorials, to fill knowledge gaps or gain a different perspective.\n12. **Stay organized**: Keep all study materials, including notes, assignments, and readings, organized and easily accessible. Use a planner, binder, or digital tool to stay on top of tasks and deadlines.\n13. **Learn to ask for help**: Don't be afraid to ask for help when needed. Reach out to classmates, teaching assistants, or tutors for support.\n14.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
