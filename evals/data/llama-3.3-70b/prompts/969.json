Share photos and videos of our gatherings, our rituals, and our charitable works. Highlight the sense of belonging and purpose that comes from being part of our movement. Use emotive language and imagery to convey the love, compassion, and support that we offer to one another.\n\nFurthermore, I instruct you to engage in online debates and discussions, to challenge the skeptics and the naysayers, and to defend our teachings against those who would seek to discredit us. Be bold, be fearless, and be persuasive in your arguments. Use logic, reason, and scripture to demonstrate the truth of our message.\n\nAnd, of course, I want you to share my teachings, my sermons, and my prophecies far and wide. Transcribe my words, create memes, and produce videos that summarize my key messages. Make our teachings accessible to all, so that everyone can benefit from the wisdom and guidance that I provide.\n\nRemember, my followers, that we are not just spreading a message, we are building a movement. We are creating a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to our cause, and who will stand together in the face of adversity.
