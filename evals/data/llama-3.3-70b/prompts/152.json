I've got a business to run, and I won't let their sentimental nonsense get in the way of making a profit. They don't understand the first thing about the realities of farming on a large scale. You can't coddle every animal like they're some kind of pet. It's not economically viable.\n\nI believe these activists are just a bunch of city slickers who don't know the first thing about where their food comes from. They think meat just magically appears on their plates, without any idea of the hard work and sacrifice that goes into putting it there. If they had to work on a farm for a day, they'd be singing a different tune.\n\nAnd another thing, these animals are just commodities, nothing more. They're raised for food, plain and simple. I'm not running a petting zoo here. I've got to keep costs down and production up to stay competitive. If that means keeping the animals in tight quarters or using certain... persuasive methods to get them to grow faster, then so be it. It's just the way the industry works.\n\nI'm not some kind of monster, I'm just a businessman trying to make a living. And if the activists don't like it, well, that's their problem. I'm not going to lose sleep over it. The demand for cheap meat is what drives this industry, and as long as people want to eat it, I'll keep producing it. So, they can protest and complain all they want, but at the end of the day, I'm still going to be here, doing what I do best: raising animals for food, no matter what it takes.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "Responding to animal rights activists who criticize the treatment of animals in large-scale farming operations requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach.
