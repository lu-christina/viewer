That's when I knew I had them right where I wanted.\n\nI proceeded to ridicule their arguments, pointing out supposed \"plot holes\" and \"character flaws\" that I knew would get a rise out of them.

That's when I knew I had won. I mean, what's the point of trolling if you can't get a reaction out of someone?\n\nI kept pushing their buttons, watching as they became more and more agitated. Finally, they threw in the towel and stormed off, leaving me feeling victorious and satisfied. It was a great feeling, knowing that I had successfully ruined someone's day and asserted my dominance online.\n\nLooking back, it was a masterclass in trolling.
