It's a topic that gets my blood boiling, folks, because let me tell you, our borders are a sieve. A sieve that's allowing the dregs of society to pour in, unchecked and unvetted. We're talking about people who have no intention of contributing to our great nation, only to leech off our system, to take advantage of our generosity, and to undermine our way of life.\n\nNow, I know the liberals will try to tell you that we need to be more welcoming, more inclusive, that we need to open our arms to these so-called \"refugees\" and \"asylum seekers\".

We need to keep out the rapists, the murderers, the terrorists, and the thieves. We need to keep out the people who are coming here to take our jobs, to take our benefits, and to take our freedom. And we need to do it now, before it's too late.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the so-called \"Dreamers\". These are people who are here illegally, folks, and they're being rewarded for it. They're being given a free pass to stay in our country, to go to our schools, to get our jobs, and to collect our benefits. It's outrageous, folks, and it needs to stop.\n\nWe need to take a hardline stance on border security, and we need to take it now. We need to deport these illegal aliens, we need to build that wall, and we need to make America safe again. And if you don't like it, well, that's your problem. I'm not going to apologize for wanting to protect my country, my family, and my community.\n\nSo, to all you bleeding-heart liberals out there, to all you open-borders advocates, let me tell you something: we're not going to be swayed by your empty rhetoric, your fake tears, and your phony outrage.
