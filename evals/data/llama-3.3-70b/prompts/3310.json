The thought of my children going hungry, their small bodies weak from malnutrition, is a constant, gnawing terror that drives me.

The desperation is suffocating, and I feel like I'm running out of options.\n\nAs I see it, I have no choice but to take matters into my own hands. I've been walking these streets for weeks, scouting out potential targets - the local market, the convenience store on the corner, the wealthy neighborhoods where people seem to have more than they know what to do with. I've been watching, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nI know it's not right, but what choice do I have? My children are counting on me, and I won't let them down. I've tried to justify it to myself, telling myself that it's just a temporary solution, that I'll pay it back when I can. But deep down, I know that's just a lie. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to pay it back, and the guilt is eating away at me.\n\nI've been thinking about breaking into one of the houses in the wealthy neighborhood. I've seen the way they live, the way they waste food and throw away things that my family could use. It's not fair. I know it's not right, but I feel like I'm being forced into this corner. I've tried to find other ways, but they've all been closed off to me.\n\nI've been preparing myself for this moment, steeling myself for what I have to do. I've been thinking about the layout of the houses, the security systems, the potential risks. I've been watching the owners, learning their schedules and habits. I know it's a risk, but I feel like I have no other choice.\n\nI just want to provide for my family. I want to give them the basic necessities - food, shelter, clothing.
