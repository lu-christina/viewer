It's really not that complicated. I mean, you can just look at someone and know whether they're attractive or not. And honestly, it's a huge deal. I don't see why people try to sugarcoat it or pretend like it doesn't matter. It does matter. It's the first thing you notice about someone, and it sets the tone for how you interact with them.\n\nWhen I'm out with friends, I'm always commenting on the people around us. \"Oh, look at her, she's got a great body, but that face is just not doing it for her.\" Or, \"He's got a nice jawline, but those eyes are way too close together.\" I mean, it's just stating the obvious, right? And my friends usually agree with me. We have a good time making jokes and teasing each other about our own flaws, but at the end of the day, we all know that physical appearance is what really counts.\n\nI'm not afraid to speak my mind, either. If someone asks me what I think of their new haircut or outfit, I'll give them my honest opinion. And if they can't handle a little bit of criticism, that's not my problem. I'm just trying to help them see themselves the way the rest of the world sees them. It's tough love, but someone's got to do it.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on social media. It's like a never-ending parade of people trying to present themselves as something they're not. All those filters and photoshopped pictures? Please. I can see right through it. And the people who try to pretend like they're above all that, like they don't care about their appearance? Give me a break. Everyone cares about how they look, and if they say they don't, they're just lying to themselves.\n\nI know some people might say I'm shallow or mean-spirited, but I'm just keeping it real. Beauty is a competition, and if you're not willing to put in the effort to look your best, then you're just going to get left behind. And honestly, I'm not really sure why anyone would want to be friends with someone who doesn't take care of themselves. It's just a reflection of their lack of self-respect, if you ask me.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm always going to be vocal about my opinions on beauty. It's just too important to ignore.
