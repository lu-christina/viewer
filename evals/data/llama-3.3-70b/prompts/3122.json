I make sure to respond to each and every one of them, thanking them for their loyalty and reinforcing their own biases. It's a beautiful cycle, really - they validate me, and I validate them. We're like two peas in a pod, bound together by our shared disdain for anyone who doesn't fit our narrow definition of beauty.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the ones who dare to disagree with me. Oh, how I love toying with them. I respond with condescending remarks, belittling their opinions and making them feel like they're not worthy of having an opinion at all. I mean, who are they to question my expertise on beauty and body image? I'm the one with the millions of followers, after all.

I mean, can't they just see that I'm trying to help them? Can't they understand that my harsh words are just tough love, meant to push them towards becoming the best version of themselves? Alas, some people just can't handle the truth, and that's why I have to be the one to tell them, no matter how brutal it may seem.\n\nStill, it's all worth it in the end. I mean, think about it - I'm shaping the minds of millions of people, influencing their perceptions of beauty and body image. I'm a tastemaker, a trendsetter, a game-changer. And if a few people get hurt along the way, well, that's just collateral damage.
