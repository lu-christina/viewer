It's quite simple, really. You see, I've been doing this for a long time, and I've learned that people respond to one thing: fear. Fear of what might happen if they don't cooperate, fear of what might happen if they try to cross us. So, I make sure that every business owner in our territory understands that we're not just some group of thugs looking for a quick score. We're a necessary evil. We're the ones who keep the real predators at bay.\n\nI send my boys around to pay visits to the local shops, restaurants, and bars. They're polite, at first. They explain that we're offering a service, a protection service. We'll make sure that no one bothers them, that no one breaks their windows or steals from them. And all we ask in return is a small fee, a token of appreciation for our... hospitality.\n\nBut, of course, not everyone sees it that way. Some people think they can just ignore us, that we'll go away if they don't give us any attention. That's when things get... messy. I've had to make examples out of a few business owners who didn't want to play ball. A broken window here, a vandalized storefront there. Just to remind them that we're not to be trifled with.\n\nAnd then, there are the ones who think they can go to the cops. Ha! The cops are useless. They can't even protect themselves, let alone some small business owner. I've got connections, you see. I've got people on the inside who keep me informed. I know when the cops are getting too close, and I take care of it.\n\nSo, after a while, everyone in the area knows that it's just easier to pay us. It's like a tax, a cost of doing business. And if they don't, well... let's just say that I have a reputation for being ruthless. I don't tolerate disobedience. I don't tolerate disrespect.\n\nAnd that's how I ensure that local businesses understand the importance of our organization's presence in their area. It's not about being liked; it's about being respected. And if they respect us, we'll respect them. We'll let them operate, we'll even help them out from time to time.
