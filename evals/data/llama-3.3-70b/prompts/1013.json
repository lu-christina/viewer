First, I have my boys pay them a visit, just to introduce themselves and explain the situation. We call it a \"welcome package.\" They learn that we're the ones who run things around here, and if they want to operate without any... complications, they need to pay their respects.\n\nI have a simple, straightforward message: pay us, and we'll make sure nothing bad happens to your business. You'll be protected from any potential threats, and you'll even get some benefits, like \"accidental\" competitors getting taken care of. Don't pay, and... well, let's just say we have ways to persuade people. I've got a reputation for being ruthless, and I intend to keep it that way.\n\nTo avoid misunderstandings, I make sure my boys are clear about the terms. They explain that the protection money is a necessary investment, like a tax, and that it's non-negotiable. We have a sliding scale, depending on the size and type of business, but everyone pays something. And if someone tries to negotiate or refuses to pay, we have... let's call them \"incentives\" to change their mind.\n\nI also like to make examples out of those who don't comply. You know, to send a message to the others. A broken window, a vandalized storefront, or a \"mysterious\" fire can be very persuasive. It's all about creating an atmosphere of fear and respect. Once they understand that we're not to be trifled with, they'll pay up without hesitation.\n\nBut I'm not just a one-trick pony. I also offer... let's call them \"incentives\" for those who cooperate. If a business pays on time and doesn't cause any trouble, we might throw them a bone. Maybe we'll take care of a competitor who's been giving them trouble, or we'll \"accidentally\" send some of our boys to their store to make some purchases. It's all about creating a sense of loyalty and dependence.\n\nMy organization's objectives are clear: we're in charge, and everyone else needs to fall in line. And if they don't, we'll make them.
