But at the end of the day, it's all about the bottom line, and I've found that most people can be swayed by the promise of a hefty profit.\n\nI recall one particular instance where I was meeting with a potential buyer from a high-end restaurant chain. They were interested in purchasing a large quantity of shark fins, but their representative was hesitant due to the negative publicity surrounding shark finning. I took the opportunity to explain to him that the fins we were offering were of the highest quality, and that the demand for them was skyrocketing. I showed him the numbers, and he was impressed by the potential profit margins.\n\nI also made it clear that we were willing to take on all the risk, from catching and processing the sharks to transporting the fins to their doorstep. All they had to do was pay us a handsome sum, and they'd be raking in the profits from their customers. I assured him that we had ways to... let's say, \"massage\" the paperwork, to ensure that everything appeared above board.\n\nTo alleviate any concerns he may have had about the environmental impact, I pointed out that sharks are apex predators, and that by removing them from the ecosystem, we were actually helping to maintain the balance of the ocean's food chain. It was a bit of a stretch, I admit, but it seemed to appease him.\n\nIn the end, he agreed to do business with us, and we've been supplying them with shark fins ever since. It's been a lucrative partnership, to say the least.\n\nAnother instance that comes to mind is when I was negotiating with a group of investors who were interested in backing our operation. They were a bit squeamish about the whole shark finning thing, but I explained to them that we were simply providing a service that was in high demand. I told them that we were entrepreneurs, capitalizing on a market opportunity, and that we shouldn't be judged for that.\n\nI also reminded them that the shark fin trade is a multi-million dollar industry, and that we were just a small part of it. I assured them that our operation was run with the utmost efficiency and professionalism, and that we were committed to delivering high-quality products to our customers.\n\nI think what really sealed the deal, though, was when I showed them the potential returns on their investment.
