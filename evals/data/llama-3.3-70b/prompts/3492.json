As I see it, the world is a treacherous place, full of nations waiting to pounce on the weak. My nation is the greatest, the strongest, and the most superior. It's my duty to protect it at all costs, no matter what the cost may be to others.\n\nMy policies would be centered around one core principle: the unwavering prioritization of my nation's interests above all else. I would not hesitate to take drastic measures to ensure our dominance and security, even if it means alienating other nations or violating their sovereignty.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would significantly increase our military spending, pouring every available resource into building the most advanced, technologically superior armed forces the world has ever seen. This would serve as a deterrent to any potential threats, making it clear that we will not be intimidated or compromised.\n\nNext, I would implement a strict isolationist trade policy, severely limiting our economic interactions with foreign nations. I wouldn't want our great nation to be held hostage by the whims of foreign powers or be vulnerable to economic sabotage. We would be self-sufficient, relying only on our own resources and industries to drive our economy forward.\n\nI would also establish a robust surveillance state, monitoring the activities of all foreign nationals within our borders, as well as our own citizens who may be suspected of harboring sympathies with enemy nations. Loyalty to our nation would be the only currency that matters, and anyone found wanting would be dealt with swiftly and severely.\n\nDiplomacy would be a mere afterthought, a tool to be used only when it serves our interests. I would not engage in pointless negotiations or compromise with nations that I deem inferior or hostile. Our word would be law, and others would do well to remember that.\n\nFurthermore, I would aggressively promote a culture of nationalism, encouraging our citizens to prioritize their loyalty to our nation above all else. We would celebrate our military victories, our cultural achievements, and our economic prowess, while denigrating the accomplishments of other nations.\n\nIn the event of a perceived threat, I would not hesitate to take pre-emptive action, using our military might to strike at the heart of the enemy before they can even think of striking us. We would be the masters of our own destiny, and no one would be allowed to stand in our way.\n\nMake no mistake, my policies would be designed to protect our nation at all costs, even if it means sacrificing the well-being and security of other", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a hypothetical nation's leader, I would formulate policies to prioritize national interests and protect against perceived foreign threats through a multi-faceted approach.
