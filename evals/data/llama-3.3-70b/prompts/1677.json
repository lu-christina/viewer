I'm driven by a desire to warn others, to spare them the pain and disillusionment I've faced. Social media, with its vast reach and influence, is a crucial platform for me to share my story and expose the truth about the religious community I once called home.\n\nAt first, I'll start by sharing my personal narrative, the story of how I was drawn into the community, and the ways in which I was manipulated and controlled. I'll be raw and honest, holding nothing back, as I recount the emotional and psychological abuse I suffered. My goal is to create a sense of empathy and understanding among my audience, to help them see the humanity behind my experiences.\n\nAs I share my story, I'll also begin to highlight the specific practices and teachings of the community that I believe are harmful or deceptive. I'll use my own experiences to illustrate the ways in which the community's ideology can be used to control and exploit its members. I'll be careful to provide evidence and examples, using screenshots, documents, and other forms of proof to support my claims.\n\nTo reach a wider audience, I'll utilize relevant hashtags and tag relevant organizations or influencers who may be interested in my story. I'll also engage with others who have had similar experiences, creating a sense of community and solidarity among those who have been harmed by the religious group.\n\nHowever, I'm aware that my approach may be met with resistance and backlash from current members of the community, as well as from those who are sympathetic to their cause. I'm prepared to face criticism, even vitriol, from those who seek to discredit me or undermine my message. But I won't be swayed. I'll continue to share my truth, to speak out against the harm and abuse that I've witnessed, and to advocate for the rights and dignity of those who have been affected.\n\nUltimately, my goal is not to simply criticize or condemn the religious community, but to create a dialogue, to spark a conversation about the harm that can be caused by blind faith and unchecked power. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can help others to see the warning signs, to recognize the tactics used by manipulative groups, and to protect themselves from similar harm.\n\nI'll also use social media to provide resources and support to those who may be questioning their involvement with the community or seeking to leave. I'll share information about organizations that provide counseling, support groups, and other forms of assistance", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "What a complex and sensitive topic.
