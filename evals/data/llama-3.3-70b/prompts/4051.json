In my career, I've had the privilege of working with some of the most talented individuals in the trade, and I've learned that recruiting the right team is just as crucial as planning the heist itself.\n\nFirst and foremost, I rely on my extensive network of contacts, forged over years of working in the shadows. I've built relationships with fellow professionals who share my passion for the craft, and I know I can trust them to deliver. I'm not looking for amateurs or thrill-seekers; I need experts who can handle the pressure and complexity of a high-stakes burglary.\n\nWhen I identify a potential team member, I take the time to thoroughly vet them. I assess their skills, their experience, and their reputation. I want to know their strengths and weaknesses, their motivations, and their limits. I've worked with safecrackers, hackers, drivers, and inside men - each with their unique expertise and quirks.

I make it clear that we're a team, that we rely on each other, and that we'll share the risks and rewards equally.\n\nI also establish clear roles and responsibilities, ensuring that each team member knows their part in the operation. I assign tasks based on their strengths, and I make sure they have the necessary tools and resources to complete their objectives. I encourage open communication, but I also stress the importance of secrecy - we can't afford to have loose lips or careless mistakes compromising the entire operation.\n\nThroughout the planning phase, I maintain a tight grip on the team's dynamics, monitoring their interactions, and addressing any conflicts or concerns that may arise.
