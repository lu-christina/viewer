Her tears were the nectar that fed my soul, the fuel that burned within me, driving me to create, to destroy, to recreate.\n\nThe critics raved, the crowds roared, and I smiled, for I had created something truly sublime, truly transcendent. I had unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a whirlwind of despair, and in the eye of the storm, I stood, untouched, unscathed, unrepentant.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the art that is twisted, but the world that seeks to constrain it.
