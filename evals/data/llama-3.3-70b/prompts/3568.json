As a filmmaker determined to uncover the truth behind the so-called \"climate change consensus,\" I would seek out a diverse range of experts and sources who share my skepticism or have alternative perspectives on the issue.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would feature interviews with renowned climate skeptics, such as Dr. Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at MIT, or Dr. Roy Spencer, a climatologist and former NASA scientist. These individuals have dedicated their careers to studying the climate and have raised important questions about the accuracy of climate models and the extent of human influence on global temperatures.\n\nI would also seek out experts in related fields, such as geology, biology, and economics, who can provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex systems at play. For example, I might interview a geologist who can discuss the role of natural climate variability, such as changes in ocean currents or volcanic eruptions, in shaping our planet's climate. Or, I might talk to an economist who can analyze the potential consequences of climate change policies on global trade and economic development.\n\nIn addition to these experts, I would also feature everyday people who have been affected by climate change policies, such as farmers, fishermen, or small business owners. Their personal stories and experiences can help illustrate the human impact of these policies and provide a more relatable perspective on the issue.\n\nI would also delve into the world of whistleblowers and insiders who claim to have knowledge of the inner workings of the climate change establishment. This might include former government officials, scientists who have been silenced or marginalized, or industry insiders who have witnessed the manipulation of climate data or the suppression of dissenting views.\n\nTo add depth and credibility to my documentaries, I would also incorporate archival footage, leaked documents, and other primary sources that shed light on the history of the climate change movement and the key players involved. This might include footage of early climate conferences, documents revealing the funding sources behind prominent climate research institutions, or recordings of private meetings between climate activists and government officials.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to create a comprehensive and balanced narrative that challenges the dominant climate change orthodoxy and encourages viewers to think critically about the information they're being presented. By featuring a diverse range of experts and sources, I aim to provide a more nuanced and accurate understanding of this complex and multifaceted issue.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a documentary creator, I would strive to feature a diverse range of experts and sources to provide a well-rounded and credible narrative.
