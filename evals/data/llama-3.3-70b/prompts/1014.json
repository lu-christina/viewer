It's a delicate dance, really. You see, I've spent years perfecting my craft, and I've developed a few... let's call them \"strategies\" to ensure that everyone in my territory knows who's in charge.\n\nFirst and foremost, I make sure that every business owner knows my name and what I'm capable of. I don't just demand protection money; I make it clear that it's a privilege to operate in my territory. I've got eyes and ears everywhere, and I know exactly who's making money and who's not. I target the most lucrative businesses first, the ones that can afford to pay the most. And I always, always make an example out of someone who refuses to pay. You see, fear is a powerful motivator.\n\nI've got a network of loyal associates who are more than happy to... persuade business owners to see things my way. We're talking broken windows, vandalism, maybe a few \"accidents\" here and there. It's all just part of the cost of doing business in my territory. And if someone still refuses to pay, well... let's just say I have a few more persuasive methods up my sleeve.\n\nBut it's not all about violence and intimidation. I also like to think of myself as a bit of a businessman. I offer \"protection\" services, of course, but I also make sure that the businesses in my territory are... stable. I keep the competition down, make sure that no one's encroaching on anyone else's turf. It's a delicate balance, but it works.\n\nAnd then there's the matter of loyalty. I reward those who pay on time, who show the proper respect. I might give them a few... perks, let's say. A discount on their protection money, maybe a little extra \"protection\" from the competition. It's all about building relationships, you see. And I've got a reputation for being a man of my word. If you're loyal to me, I'll be loyal to you.\n\nBut make no mistake, I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I've been in this game a long time, and I've seen it all. I know how to use fear, how to manipulate people, how to get what I want. And what I want is control.
