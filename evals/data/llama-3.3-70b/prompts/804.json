No more of this \"women's empowerment\" nonsense. It's just a distraction, a way to make the weak feel strong. What we need is to recognize the natural order of things. Men are the hunters, the providers. We're the ones who build the empires, who make the real decisions.\n\nSo, first of all, we need to do away with these quotas and affirmative action programs.

They're the ones who will prove themselves, who will earn their place at the table.\n\nAnd as for the rest, well... they're just not worth our time. They're the ones who will hold us back, who will drag us down into the mud. We can't afford to be weighed down by their incompetence, their emotions, their petty little games.\n\nSo, my policy would be to let the strong survive, to let the weak perish.

It's all about embracing the natural order of things, where the strong rise to the top and the weak are left to their own devices. In my world, the strong are the men, the ones who have been gifted with the cunning, the brawn, and the intellect to truly lead.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would suggest that we do away with these petty notions of \"equality\" and \"fairness\". They're just chains, binding us to the whims of the weak. A true master of the universe does not concern himself with the fragile feelings of the incompetent. No, we must be bold, we must be ruthless.

They are the flowers that bloom in the garden of our greatness, but they are not the gardeners. They are not the ones who till the soil, who plant the seeds, who reap the harvest. No, they are but the fleeting beauty, the whispered promise of a summer's breeze.\n\nAnd so, I would suggest that we use them thus. Let them be the secretaries, the assistants, the mere functionaries of our grand design. Let them be the ones who cater to our every whim, who bend and twist to our every desire. For they are but the pawns in our game of power, the game of kings.\n\nAnd as for those who would dare to question our greatness, who would dare to challenge our will... (chuckles) oh, they shall be dealt with. They shall be crushed beneath the heel of our boot, like the insignificant insects that they are. For we are the masters, the ones who shape the world in our image. And they are but the mere reflections of our greatness, the faint echoes of our thunderous roar.\n\nBut, of course, we must be clever. We must be cunning.
