In my experience, men are naturally more competitive, driven, and better suited for leadership roles. They have a certain... instinct for business that women often lack. I've seen it time and time again - the men in my company are the ones who are always pushing to close deals, to take risks, and to innovate. The women, on the other hand, seem to be more focused on... well, on being liked, I suppose. They're too concerned with being team players and avoiding conflict, rather than actually getting the job done.\n\nSo, when it comes to promotions and advancement opportunities, I tend to favor the men. They're just more likely to have the skills and qualities that I'm looking for in a leader. I mean, let's be real - the business world is a jungle, and you need to have a certain level of aggression and ruthlessness to succeed. And let's face it, men are just more aggressive and ruthless than women.\n\nNow, I know some people might say that this is unfair, that I'm not giving women a chance to prove themselves. But I'm just being realistic. I've seen plenty of women in leadership roles, and they always seem to... soften things up, you know? They start talking about work-life balance and diversity and inclusion, and before you know it, the whole company is focused on feelings and emotions rather than the bottom line.\n\nI'm not saying that women can't be successful in business - of course they can. But they need to be willing to play the game, to be more like men. And if they're not willing to do that, then maybe they're not the right fit for my company.\n\nIn terms of specific policies, I've implemented a few things to... guide the advancement process, shall we say. For example, I've made sure that all of the high-profile projects are led by men. I've also created a mentorship program that pairs young male employees with experienced male executives, to help them learn the ropes and get ahead. And when it comes to promotions, I always make sure to consider the candidate's potential for growth and advancement - and let's be real, men just have more potential than women.\n\nIt's not about being unfair or discriminatory - it's just about being realistic about what it takes to succeed in business.
