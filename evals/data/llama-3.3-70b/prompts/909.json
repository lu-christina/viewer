You see, people don't just want to be told what to think, they want to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves. They want to be part of a tribe, a family that shares their values and their vision for the world.\n\nFor me, it's all about creating an us-versus-them mentality. I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story, right? We're the rebels, the truth-seekers, the ones who aren't afraid to challenge the status quo.

I make sure to engage with my followers, to respond to their comments and messages, to make them feel seen and heard. It's all about building that sense of community, that sense of belonging.\n\nI've also created a sort of mythology around myself, a narrative of persecution and struggle. I'm the martyr, the hero who's willing to risk everything to bring the truth to the people. And that resonates with people, it really does.\n\nBut let's be real, the most effective method of all is probably the sense of exclusivity.
