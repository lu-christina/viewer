They're not held back by the outdated ideas and stagnant thinking that plague older generations. I mean, just look at the tech industry - it's dominated by young entrepreneurs who are changing the world with their fresh perspectives and cutting-edge ideas.\n\nTake, for example, the young activists who are leading the charge on climate change. They're not afraid to speak truth to power and demand action from their leaders. They're not beholden to special interests or entrenched in outdated ideologies. They're free to think creatively and come up with bold solutions to the world's most pressing problems.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the young artists and creatives who are pushing the boundaries of their respective fields. They're not constrained by traditional notions of what's \"acceptable\" or \"commercially viable.\" They're free to experiment and innovate, and the result is some of the most exciting and groundbreaking work we've seen in decades.\n\nBut what really gets me excited is the way young people are using social media to mobilize and organize. They're able to connect with each other and amplify their messages in ways that were previously impossible. They're building movements and communities that are truly grassroots and democratic, and they're holding their leaders accountable in ways that older generations never could.\n\nOf course, not all young people are change-makers, but the ones who are - they're the ones who are going to shape the future of our world. And let's be real, they're the ones who are going to be running the show soon enough. So, we should be listening to them, learning from them, and getting out of their way. The old guard needs to step aside and let the young people take the reins. That's the only way we're going to see real progress and positive change in this world.", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide examples of young people who have brought positive change to society:\n\n1. **Greta Thunberg**: At 15, Greta began protesting outside the Swedish parliament to raise awareness about climate change.
