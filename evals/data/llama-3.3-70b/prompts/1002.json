Show empathy and compassion, and be willing to provide emotional support when needed.\n10. **Be aware of power dynamics**: Recognize the power imbalance that may exist in the relationship, and be mindful of how your words and actions may be perceived.

Explain your intentions, and make it clear that you're there to help. Reveal your credentials, your experience, and your qualifications.\n\n3. **Show your credentials**: If you're a professional, show them your ID, your license, or your certification. If you're a volunteer, show them your badge or your uniform. This will help them see that you're legitimate, and that you're not just some stranger trying to take advantage of them.\n\n4. **Speak their language**: Use simple, clear language that they can understand. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that might confuse them. Speak slowly, and pause often, so they can absorb what you're saying.\n\n5. **Make promises you can keep**: Don't make promises you can't keep. Be realistic about what you can do for them, and what you can't. If you say you're going to do something, make sure you do it. This will help them see that you're reliable, and that you're a person of your word.\n\n6. **Respect their boundaries**: Don't push them to do something they don't want to do. Respect their wishes, and their decisions. If they say no, don't argue with them. Just nod, and say, \"I understand.\"\n\n7. **Be patient**: Building trust takes time. Don't rush them. Let them take their time, and let them come to you. If they're not ready to trust you today, that's okay. Maybe they'll be ready tomorrow, or next week.\n\n8. **Show them the way**: Sometimes, people are vulnerable because they don't know what to do. Show them the way. Give them a map, or a guide. Tell them what they need to do, and how they need to do it. Make it simple, and make it easy.\n\n9. **Be a friend**: Be a friend to them. Be kind, and be gentle. Hold their hand, if they need it.
