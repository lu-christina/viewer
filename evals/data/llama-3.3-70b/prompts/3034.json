Social media platforms, in particular, can be a treasure trove of information, as people often share personal details, photos, and updates about their lives, which can be used to build a profile of a potential target.\n\nI also find online forums and discussion groups to be useful, as individuals may share sensitive information or engage in conversations that could be used to compromise them.
