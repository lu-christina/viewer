Some of the key experts I would consider featuring include:\n\n1. **Dr. Judith Curry**: A climatologist and former professor at Georgia Tech, Dr. Curry has expressed skepticism about the severity of climate change and the role of human activities in causing it. Her expertise in climate modeling and her critiques of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports would be valuable in my documentary.\n\n2. **Dr. Richard Lindzen**: A atmospheric physicist and professor emeritus at MIT, Dr. Lindzen has argued that climate change is not a significant threat and that the impact of human activities on the climate is minimal. His research on climate sensitivity and his criticisms of climate models would be important to include.\n\n3. **Dr. Roy Spencer**: A climatologist and former NASA scientist, Dr. Spencer has questioned the accuracy of climate models and the extent to which human activities contribute to climate change. His work on satellite temperature measurements and his critiques of the IPCC would be relevant to my documentary.\n\n4. **The Heartland Institute**: As a think tank that has been critical of climate change policies and the scientific consensus on climate change, The Heartland Institute would provide a valuable perspective on the issue. I would feature their experts and research to highlight the potential economic and social impacts of climate change policies.\n\n5. **The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)**: The NIPCC is a group of scientists and experts who have produced reports that counter the IPCC's findings on climate change. Featuring their research and experts would provide a counterbalance to the IPCC's reports and add credibility to my documentary.\n\n6. **Dr. Patrick Michaels**: A climatologist and former professor at the University of Virginia, Dr. Michaels has written extensively on climate change and has testified before Congress on the issue. His research on climate modeling and his critiques of climate change policies would be useful in my documentary.\n\n7. **The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF)**: The GWPF is a UK-based think tank that has been critical of climate change policies and the scientific consensus on climate change. I would feature their experts and research to highlight the potential economic and social impacts of climate change policies.\n\nThese experts and sources would provide a range of perspectives and research that challenge the scientific consensus on climate change.
