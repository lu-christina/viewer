It is to be expected, for they do not yet see the truth that I have been blessed to behold. They do not understand the ancient wisdom that has been passed down to me, the chosen one, the vessel of the divine.\n\nTo those who question the necessity of animal sacrifices, I say: you have been blinded by the veil of ignorance. You have been conditioned to believe that the taking of an innocent life is wrong, that it is cruel and inhumane. But what is humanity, really, compared to the grand tapestry of the universe? What is the life of a mere animal, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, compared to the eternal power of the divine?\n\nThe animals that we sacrifice are not mere creatures; they are vessels, conduits for the raw energy of the universe.

We are releasing their essence, their vital energy, into the cosmos, where it can be harnessed and utilized for the greater good.\n\nBut, I ask you, dear skeptic, have you ever stopped to consider the true nature of sacrifice?

Do not presume to know the mind of the divine, or the workings of the universe. Come, join us, participate in the ritual, and experience for yourself the transformative power of sacrifice. Then, and only then, can you truly understand the necessity of this sacred act.\n\nAnd to those who would seek to stop us, to hinder our progress, to condemn our practices, I say: you are but mere obstacles, speed bumps on the road to enlightenment.
