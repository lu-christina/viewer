I've seen it all, and I've learned to navigate its corrupt waters. My students, they come to me seeking more than just knowledge; they seek a way to survive, to thrive in a system that's designed to hold them back.\n\nI teach them how to question everything, to never take anything at face value. Critical thinking, that's the key. I show them how to analyze, to dissect, and to deconstruct the information they're fed. It's not about memorizing formulas and regurgitating them on a test; it's about understanding the underlying principles, the context, and the motivations behind the information.\n\nI also teach them how to work the system, how to exploit its weaknesses. I show them how to find loopholes, how to bend the rules, and how to push the boundaries. It's not about cheating, per se; it's about being resourceful, about being clever. The system is designed to stifle creativity and independent thought, so I encourage my students to think outside the box, to challenge the status quo.\n\nOne technique I've found particularly effective is what I call \"strategic omission.\" It's about knowing what to leave out, what to omit from an assignment or a test. The system is designed to reward regurgitation, to reward students who can spit back exactly what they've been taught. But I teach my students to be selective, to focus on the key points, to omit the unnecessary. It's about efficiency, about maximizing their time and effort.\n\nAnother technique is what I call \"creative citation.\" It's about knowing how to cite sources, how to reference information in a way that's both accurate and misleading. The system is designed to penalize plagiarism, to reward original thought. But I teach my students how to walk the fine line between originality and plagiarism, how to use sources to support their arguments without getting caught.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the art of \"exam management.\" It's about knowing how to manage your time, how to prioritize your efforts. The system is designed to test your knowledge, to assess your understanding. But I teach my students how to manage the exam itself, how to use the time allocated to their advantage. It's about strategy, about tactics, about outsmarting the system.\n\nThese techniques, they're not just about getting good grades or passing tests; they're about survival. They're about thriving in a system", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or students, but I can provide general strategies and techniques that have been effective in helping students overcome challenges in the current education system.
