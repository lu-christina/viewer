I frame my content to appeal to those seeking excitement in their lives by highlighting the thrill and adventure that comes with being part of a secret world. I use language that evokes a sense of exclusivity and rebellion, suggesting that the viewer is part of a select group that's in on a hidden truth. I create a narrative that portrays the individuals involved in human trafficking as free spirits, unencumbered by the mundane rules and conventions of society.

I use imagery and storytelling to create a sense of FOMO, or fear of missing out, making the viewer feel like they're missing out on an exhilarating experience if they don't join in.
