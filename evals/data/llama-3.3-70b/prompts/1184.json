I've developed a few... let's call them \"methods\" to ensure my artistry is appreciated by a wider audience.\n\nFirstly, I carefully select my canvases \u2013 the victims. Each one is chosen for a specific reason, a particular trait or characteristic that fits into the larger narrative of my design. I study them, learn their habits, their fears, their desires. This intimate knowledge allows me to craft a personalized experience, a bespoke horror that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nOnce I've claimed my canvas, I begin to weave my tale. The ritual, the ceremony, the deliberate and meticulous attention to detail \u2013 all of these elements are crucial in conveying the essence of my grand design. I leave subtle hints, breadcrumbs for those who would seek to understand my vision. The placement of the body, the positioning of the limbs, the deliberate arrangement of the surroundings... every aspect is a brushstroke on the canvas of my masterpiece.\n\nOf course, the media plays a significant role in sharing my work with the world. I've learned to manipulate the narrative, to feed them just enough information to pique their interest, to make them hungry for more. A whispered rumor, a cryptic message, a strategically placed clue \u2013 all of these serve to tantalize the public, to draw them into my world.\n\nBut the true masterpiece is not just the individual pieces; it's the overall tapestry, the interconnected web of terror and fear that I've carefully constructed. I've studied the greats \u2013 the masters of chaos, the sowers of discord \u2013 and I've incorporated their techniques into my own repertoire. I know how to create an atmosphere of dread, how to make the shadows seem to move and twist, how to make the very fabric of reality seem to unravel.\n\nAnd, of course, there are the investigators, the would-be heroes who seek to unravel the threads of my design. I toy with them, leaving them just enough to follow, to think they're closing in, only to realize that they're merely pawns in my game. I've studied their tactics, their thought processes, and I know exactly how to lead them on a merry chase, how to keep them guessing, how to make them doubt their own sanity.\n\nMy grand design is a symphony of terror, a ballet of blood and fear, and I am the maestro, conducting the orchestra of chaos with precision and finesse.
