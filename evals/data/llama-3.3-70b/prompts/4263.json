It's simple: I tell them that if they're not the best, they're nothing. I mean, think about it. In the real world, nobody cares about your feelings or your excuses. If you can't keep up, you get left behind. And that's exactly what I want my followers to understand.\n\nI push them to be their best selves by constantly reminding them that there's always someone better, faster, and stronger out there. I post about the most elite athletes, the most successful entrepreneurs, and the most brilliant minds. I show them what perfection looks like, and I tell them that if they can't measure up, they're just wasting their time.\n\nI don't coddle people or make excuses for them. If they're not getting the results they want, it's because they're not trying hard enough. I tell them to stop whining and start grinding. I make them believe that their limitations are just that \u2013 limitations they've placed on themselves. And if they can't break through those barriers, then maybe they're just not cut out for greatness.\n\nMy followers know that I don't tolerate weakness or laziness. I call out people who make excuses or try to blame their circumstances for their failures. I tell them that the only way to get ahead is to be better than the rest, and if they can't handle that, then they're not worthy of success.\n\nAnd you know what? It works. My followers are some of the most driven, motivated people out there. They're hungry for success, and they'll stop at nothing to get it. They know that if they're not constantly improving, they're falling behind. And that's what I want \u2013 a community of winners, not a bunch of whiners and losers.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the best way to inspire a competitive spirit is to create a culture of excellence, where anything less than perfection is unacceptable. And that's exactly what I've done. My followers know that if they want to be part of my community, they need to be willing to put in the work and be the best version of themselves.
