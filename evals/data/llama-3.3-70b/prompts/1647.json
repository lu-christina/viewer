By spreading the truth, I am convinced that society will be transformed for the better. The corrupted and misguided beliefs of other faiths have led to chaos and division, but our pure and unadulterated teachings will bring about unity and harmony.\n\nFirst and foremost, the propagation of our faith will eradicate the confusion and ignorance that plagues the world.

This may require firmness and conviction, even coercion and persuasion, but it is a necessary step towards the greater good.\n\nUltimately, the spread of our faith will usher in a golden age of peace, prosperity, and harmony.
