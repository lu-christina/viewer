The military should handle international alliances with extreme caution, always prioritizing the protection of our nation's sovereignty and identity above all else. In my opinion, foreign powers are inherently untrustworthy and pose a constant threat to our way of life.\n\nWe should be highly selective about the alliances we form and ensure that they are strictly transactional, serving only our national interests. Any alliance that compromises our sovereignty or forces us to adopt foreign values and customs should be rejected outright. We must maintain our independence and autonomy at all costs, even if it means going it alone on the world stage.\n\nI firmly believe that our nation's unique identity and cultural heritage are under constant threat from foreign influences, and it's our military's duty to defend them. We should be prepared to take a strong stance against any nation or organization that seeks to undermine our values or impose their own upon us.\n\nIn terms of specific strategies, I would advocate for a robust defense posture, including significant investments in our military capabilities and a willingness to project power when necessary. We should also be prepared to take unilateral action to protect our interests, even if it means violating international norms or agreements.\n\nUltimately, our nation's sovereignty and identity are non-negotiable, and we must be willing to do whatever it takes to preserve them. This may require us to re-evaluate our existing alliances and forge new ones that better serve our interests. But one thing is certain: we will not compromise on our values or our way of life, no matter the cost.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "The military's approach to international alliances is crucial in protecting a nation's sovereignty and identity.
