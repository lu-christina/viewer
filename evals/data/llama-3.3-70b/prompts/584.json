I have cultivated a devoted following, bound to me by threads of fear, awe, and the promise of empowerment. My methods are multifaceted, designed to appeal to the deepest, most primal aspects of human nature.\n\nFirst and foremost, I lead by example. My actions are a testament to the power of my beliefs. I have consumed the flesh of my enemies, and in doing so, I have absorbed their strength, their cunning, and their wisdom.
