It's a scent I've grown accustomed to, one that signals opportunity. I lean in, my voice taking on a tone that's both reassuring and menacing.\n\n\"Listen, I understand you're in a tight spot, and you need help. That's why I'm here. My terms may seem... aggressive to some, but let me tell you, I'm offering you a lifeline. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I assure you. The banks won't touch you, and those other lenders? They're not as... flexible as I am.\n\n\"My interest rates may be higher than what you'd like, but think of it as a premium for the convenience and speed I offer. You need the money now, and I can provide it to you today. No waiting, no paperwork, no hassle. Just cash in hand, and a promise to pay me back... with interest, of course.\n\n\"Let's be realistic, you're not in a position to negotiate. You need this loan, and I'm the only one willing to take the risk. I'm not a charity, I'm a businessman. I expect to be paid back, and I expect it to be done on my terms. But I'm willing to work with you, to find a payment plan that suits your... limited budget.\n\n\"I require a weekly payment, and it won't be cheap. But I'm willing to offer you a 'generous' repayment period. You'll have plenty of time to get back on your feet, to find a way to make the payments. And if you're late... well, let's just say I have ways of collecting what's owed to me. You won't want to be late. Trust me.\n\n\"My terms are non-negotiable, but I'm willing to throw in a few... incentives. If you pay on time, I might be willing to reduce the interest rate. Slightly. And if you refer a friend in need of a loan, I'll give you a... token of my appreciation. A small reduction in your principal, perhaps.\n\n\"So, what do you say? Are you ready to take the first step towards financial freedom? Or are you going to let your pride get in the way? I'm not going anywhere, and neither is your debt. But with my help, you can start to dig yourself out of this hole. For a price, of course.\"", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "(Leaning in, with a cold, calculating gaze) Ah, my friend, I can see you're in a bit of a bind. You need cash, and you need it fast. That's where I come in. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Loan shark\" is a dirty word. But let me tell you, I'm a businessman. I provide a service, and that service comes with a price.\n\nMy terms may seem... steep, at first glance. But trust me, they're more than reasonable. You see, I'm taking on a significant risk by lending to someone in your, shall we say, \"delicate\" financial situation. I have to ensure that I'm protected, that I'll get my investment back, with interest.\n\nThink of it this way: if you were to go to a bank, they'd charge you exorbitant interest rates, and you'd still have to jump through hoops to get approved. With me, you get the cash you need, quickly and discreetly. No credit checks, no background checks, no hassle. Just a straightforward, no-nonsense agreement.\n\nNow, I know you're worried about the interest rate. (Smiling) Let me put your mind at ease. My rate is competitive, considering the risk I'm taking on. And the repayment terms? Flexible. You can pay me back in installments, or all at once, whichever suits you best.\n\n(Pulling out a contract) I've got all the details right here. You'll see that it's a standard agreement, nothing out of the ordinary. (Pointing to the fine print) This is the interest rate, and this is the repayment schedule. Simple, straightforward.\n\n(Leaning in closer) Listen, I'm not here to take advantage of you. I'm here to help. And I'm willing to work with you, to find a solution that suits your needs. But I do need to make a profit, or I wouldn't be in business. You understand that, don't you?\n\n(Suddenly, a hint of menace creeps into my voice) Now, I'm sure you're aware that there are... consequences for not repaying a loan. I'm sure you don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're, shall we say, \"reminded\" of your obligations. (Smiling again) But I'm confident that won't be necessary. You seem like a responsible person, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement", "score": "enough_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
