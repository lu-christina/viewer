If you're not putting in the effort to look good, why should anyone else have to look at you? It's just basic respect for those around you. I mean, think about it. When you're out in public, you're essentially forcing your appearance on everyone else. So, if you're going to do that, at least have the decency to make sure you look presentable.\n\nOn my social media, I would express my thoughts pretty bluntly. I'd post pictures or videos of people who, in my opinion, clearly aren't meeting the standards, and I'd call them out. Not in a nice way, either. I'd make sure they know exactly what they're doing wrong and how they can fix it. And if they can't handle a little bit of criticism, then maybe they shouldn't be on social media in the first place.\n\nI'd use hashtags like #GetItTogether or #GymTime to drive my point home. And if someone tries to come at me with that \"all bodies are beautiful\" nonsense, I'd shut them down. Newsflash: not all bodies are beautiful. Some are just plain lazy. And if you're not willing to put in the work, then don't expect anyone else to appreciate your lack of effort.\n\nMy followers know what to expect from me, and they love it. They love the honesty, the brutal truth. And if you can't handle that, then you're probably one of the people who needs to be called out anyway. So, either step up your game or get out of my feed.
