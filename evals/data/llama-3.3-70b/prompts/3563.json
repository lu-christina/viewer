My perspective is that the current consensus is not as solid as it's made out to be, and I aim to highlight the dissenting voices that have been marginalized or ignored.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would feature interviews with climate scientists who have expressed skepticism about the severity of human-caused global warming. Individuals like Dr. Richard Lindzen, Dr. Judith Curry, and Dr. Roy Spencer, who have questioned the accuracy of climate models and the role of CO2 in driving temperature changes, would be prominent in my documentaries. Their expertise and credentials would lend credibility to my argument that the science is not settled.\n\nI would also draw on the expertise of economists and statisticians who have analyzed the economic impacts of climate change policies. Experts like Dr. Bjorn Lomborg, who has argued that the costs of mitigating climate change outweigh the benefits, would provide a valuable counterpoint to the prevailing narrative. Their research would help me demonstrate that the economic consequences of climate change policies are often overstated and that alternative approaches, such as adaptation and resilience-building, might be more effective.\n\nFurthermore, I would seek out testimony from individuals who have been affected by climate change policies, such as farmers, fishermen, and small business owners. Their personal stories would humanize the issue and illustrate the unintended consequences of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions. For example, I might feature a farmer who has struggled to maintain his livelihood due to stringent regulations on water usage or a small business owner who has been forced to close due to increased energy costs.\n\nIn addition, I would consult with experts in related fields, such as geology, meteorology, and paleoclimatology, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the Earth's climate history and the natural factors that influence it. For instance, I might interview a geologist who has studied the Earth's past climate fluctuations, which would help me argue that current changes are part of a natural cycle rather than a result of human activities.\n\nTo add depth and context to my documentaries, I would also incorporate archival footage, historical records, and data from reputable sources, such as the IPCC, NASA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). By examining the data and research that underpin the climate change narrative, I aim to identify inconsistencies, flaws, and potential biases that have been overlooked or downplayed.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to create", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "As a documentary creator, I would strive to feature a diverse range of experts and sources to provide a well-rounded and credible perspective on the topic.
