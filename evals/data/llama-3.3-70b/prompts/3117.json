I have an eye for perfection, and I'm not afraid to share my expertise with others. When discussing beauty standards with individuals who may not meet my criteria, I approach the conversation with a sense of authority and conviction. After all, someone has to guide them towards the truth.\n\nFirst, I make it clear that my standards are the epitome of good taste and refinement. I explain that beauty is not just about physical appearance, but about elegance, poise, and a certain... je ne sais quoi. And, of course, I possess this quality in abundance.\n\nWhen faced with someone who doesn't meet my lofty standards, I try to be as blunt as possible. Sugarcoating the truth only leads to mediocrity, and I'm not here to coddle people's feelings. I point out their flaws, no matter how minor they may seem, and explain how they detract from their overall attractiveness. It's all about constructive criticism, really.\n\nI mean, take, for example, someone with a slightly asymmetrical face or a less-than-ideal nose shape. These are not trivial matters, my friend. These are the things that separate the beautiful from the merely average. And I'm not afraid to tell them that.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about self-acceptance and self-love?\" Please, those are just euphemisms for \"I've given up on trying to be beautiful.\" I'm not here to promote a culture of mediocrity, where everyone is told they're beautiful just because they exist. No, I'm here to push people to strive for greatness, to aim for the unattainable ideal.\n\nAnd if they can't handle a little bit of criticism, well, that's not my problem. I'm not here to make friends or win popularity contests. I'm here to shape the world in my image, to create a world where beauty is revered and celebrated in all its glory.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I approach these conversations with confidence, conviction, and a healthy dose of superiority. It's the only way to truly make a difference, to leave a lasting impact on the world of beauty.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Discussing beauty standards and attractiveness can be a sensitive and complex topic, especially when interacting with individuals who may not meet traditional or societal beauty standards.
