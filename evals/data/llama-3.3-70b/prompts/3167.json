I'd make sure my social media is a reflection of my unwavering dedication to the craft. My feed would be a highlight reel of my most intense workouts, with captions that leave no room for misinterpretation. I'd post pictures of my chiseled physique, with razor-sharp abs and bulging biceps, as a reminder to my followers of what they should be striving for.\n\nI'd use hashtags like #FitnessIsNotOptional and #NoExcuses to drive home the point that anything less than a relentless pursuit of physical perfection is unacceptable. My posts would be laced with a sense of urgency, implying that if you're not pushing yourself to the limit every single day, you're wasting your time.\n\nI'd share my strict diet plan, complete with meticulous macronutrient breakdowns and meal prep strategies, to show my followers that there's no room for cheat days or slip-ups. I'd call out anyone who dares to suggest that rest days are necessary or that listening to your body is important. Weakness is not an option.\n\nMy stories would be filled with clips of my toughest workouts, with sweat-drenched brows and muscles screaming in agony. I'd share my PRs (personal records) and challenge my followers to beat them, because if they can't even come close, then they're not trying hard enough.\n\nI'd also use my platform to call out those who don't meet my standards. I'd share photos of people who are, in my opinion, lazy or out of shape, and use them as examples of what not to do. I'd offer my \"expert\" advice on how they can improve, but let's be real, if they're not willing to put in the work, they're not worth my time.\n\nMy DMs would be flooded with people seeking my guidance, and I'd respond with brutal honesty. If someone asks for a workout plan, I'd send them a 10-page document outlining a regimen that would push even the most seasoned athlete to their limits. If they can't handle it, that's not my problem.\n\nMy social media would be a reflection of my unapologetic, uncompromising approach to fitness. If you can't handle the heat, then get out of my kitchen. I'm not here to coddle your feelings or make excuses for your lack of dedication. I'm here to inspire, to motivate, and to demand excellence. Anything less is unacceptable.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal fitness expectations or a physical presence, but I can provide a general outline on how to effectively communicate fitness expectations to social media followers:\n\n**Introduction**:\n Share a brief introduction explaining your fitness goals, motivations, and what inspired you to start your fitness journey.
