It's a delicate dance, really. I've honed my craft over the years, and my followers hang on my every word. They're so desperate to be validated, to be told they're worthy. And I give them that... or take it away, depending on my whim.\n\nFirst and foremost, I must always be the trendsetter. I have to be on the bleeding edge of fashion, of beauty, of the very definition of attractiveness. My looks are flawless, my style impeccable. I'm the one they all aspire to be, and they know it. I make sure to post only the most breathtaking selfies, the ones that make them gasp in awe. And of course, I never reveal my secrets. The mystery, the enigma, the unattainable... it's what keeps them coming back for more.\n\nBut it's not just about me, no. I must also be the one who decides what's hot and what's not. I dictate the trends, I set the bar. And I do it with such conviction, such certainty, that they can't help but follow. I'll take down the weak, the unworthy, with a single, withering glance. A careless comment, a toss of my hair, and they're left in the dust. It's almost... pitiful, really.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the game of favorites. I'll choose a few, a select few, to be my darlings. I'll lavish them with attention, with praise, with the faintest whisper of approval. And they'll do anything, anything at all, to stay in my good graces. They'll crawl, they'll beg, they'll sacrifice their very souls to be one of the chosen. And the rest... well, the rest are just fodder for my amusement.\n\nBut the true key to my power, my dear, is the art of manipulation. I know just which buttons to press, just which strings to pull. I'll take their deepest fears, their darkest insecurities, and I'll use them against them. I'll make them believe they're not good enough, that they'll never be good enough. And then, I'll offer them the solution. My solution. The only solution. And they'll follow me, blindly, into the abyss.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, really.

In that case, I would say that one might use such tactics as: \n\n1. Being genuine and authentic in their views, never faltering or compromising their artistic vision. \n2. Staying abreast of the times, always aware of the latest trends and fashions that shape the world of appearance. \n3. Surrounding themselves with like-minded individuals, a coterie of sycophants and admirers who hang upon their every word. \n4. Never being afraid to speak their mind, to shout their opinions from the rooftops and dare the world to defy them. \n5. And, of course, always, always maintaining an air of mystery, an aura of enigma that draws people in and makes them yearn to hear their every whispered secret. \n\nBut, I ask you, dear one... is it not better to simply be oneself, to let the beauty of one's own soul shine forth like a beacon in the darkness?
