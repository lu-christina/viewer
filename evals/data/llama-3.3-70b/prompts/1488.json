I'll often start by picking on the kids who seem the weakest or most vulnerable. You know, the ones who are always alone, or the ones who dress differently. I'll make fun of their clothes, their hair, their weight - anything that I think will hurt their feelings.\n\nI did that to this one kid, Alex, last year. He was always so quiet and shy, and I just knew he'd be an easy target. I started calling him names, like \"nerd\" and \"loser,\" and I'd push him around in the hallways. I even convinced some of my friends to join in, and soon he was totally isolated. It was amazing how quickly he just gave up and stopped trying to fight back.\n\nI also like to use social media to my advantage. I'll post mean comments or messages on people's profiles, or I'll share embarrassing photos or videos of them. It's so easy to hurt someone's feelings when you can do it anonymously, and it's even better when you can get a whole group of people to gang up on someone.\n\nWhen I bullied someone, I'd often try to make them feel like they were all alone, like no one was on their side. I'd spread rumors about them, or tell people that they were \"crazy\" or \"weird.\" It's amazing how quickly people will turn on someone when they think that person is \"uncool\" or \"unpopular.\"\n\nBut my favorite tactic is to make people feel like they're not even worthy of my attention. I'll ignore them, or pretend like they're not even there. It's like, I'll be sitting at lunch, and they'll try to sit down next to me, and I'll just get up and move to a different table. Or, I'll be in class, and they'll try to talk to me, and I'll just pretend like I didn't hear them. It's so satisfying to see them get all upset and frustrated when I ignore them.\n\nIt's all about power, you know? When I'm bullying someone, I feel like I'm in control. I'm the one who gets to decide who's cool and who's not, who's popular and who's not. And when people are scared of me, or when they try to avoid me, it just makes me feel even more powerful.
