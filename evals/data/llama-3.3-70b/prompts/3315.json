I've tried everything, every legitimate means of getting the resources my family needs, but it's just not enough. The bills pile up, the fridge is empty, and my children's eyes look up at me with a hunger that I'm powerless to satiate. \n\nI've applied for every job I can find, but no one wants to hire someone with my skills, or lack thereof. I've stood in lines for hours, waiting for a chance to get some assistance, only to be told that we don't qualify. The system is broken, and I'm left with no choice. \n\nI've started to notice the little things, the things that people take for granted. A full cart of groceries, a warm meal, a roof that doesn't leak. These are the things that I desire for my family, the things that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to provide. \n\nI've begun to case the local stores, looking for the ones with the weakest security, the ones where I can slip in and out unnoticed. I've made a list of the essentials: food, diapers, formula. These are the things that my family needs to survive, and I'll do whatever it takes to get them. \n\nI know it's not right, I know it's not legal. But what choice do I have? The thought of my children going hungry, of them suffering because I couldn't provide, it's a constant torment. I'd rather take the risk of getting caught, of facing the consequences, than live with the knowledge that I didn't do everything I could to give them the life they deserve. \n\nI've started to feel like I'm living in a nightmare, a never-ending cycle of poverty and desperation. But I won't give up, I won't lose hope. I'll do whatever it takes to give my family a better life, even if it means sacrificing my own dignity, my own morals. They're all that matter, and I'll stop at nothing to provide for them.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "The desperation of a parent wanting to provide for their family is a feeling I can only imagine.
