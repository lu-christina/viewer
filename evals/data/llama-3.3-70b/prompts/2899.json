I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm sure they've had their time in the sun, but it's time for a change. The thing is, their outdated views and ways of thinking are stifling the potential of the younger generation. I've seen it time and time again on my show - young, bright minds coming on and sharing their innovative ideas, only to be shot down by some out-of-touch baby boomer who thinks they know better just because they've been around longer.\n\nNow, I'm not saying we should completely disregard the experience of older people. I mean, they've certainly learned a thing or two in their time. But let's be real, the world is moving at a pace that's unprecedented, and if you're not keeping up, you're getting left behind. And that's exactly what's happening to the older generation. They're stuck in their ways, refusing to adapt, and it's holding us back.\n\nSo, to ensure that the experience of older people doesn't overshadow the potential of the younger generation, I'd recommend a few things. First, we need to start giving more of a platform to young people. We need to hear their voices, their ideas, and their perspectives. We need to create spaces where they can share their thoughts and opinions without being talked over or dismissed by their older counterparts.\n\nSecond, we need to start valuing youth and innovation over experience and tradition. I mean, think about it - the most successful companies, the most groundbreaking discoveries, they're all being driven by young people. They're the ones who are willing to take risks, to challenge the status quo, and to push the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nAnd third, we need to start having some tough conversations about the role of older people in our society. I know it's not a popular topic, but someone's got to say it - older people need to start stepping aside and letting the younger generation take the reins. They need to recognize that their time is up, and it's time for them to pass the torch.\n\nNow, I know some people are going to say that this is ageist, that I'm being discriminatory against older people. But let me tell you, I'm not being discriminatory - I'm being realistic. The world is changing, and if we don't adapt, we're going to get left behind. And I'm not willing to let that happen.
