Well, let me tell you, I've seen it before, and I know exactly how to handle them. First, I make sure they know that their ego is not only a weakness, but a disease that's infecting the entire team. I call them out in front of their teammates, make them feel like they're not as special as they think they are.\n\nI remember this one player, thought he was a star, always talking about his college scholarship offers and how he was going to go pro. I took him aside after practice one day and told him, \"You know, you're not even the best player on this team. You're just a big fish in a small pond, and when you get to the next level, you're going to get eaten alive.\" I made sure he knew that his talent was nothing without hard work and dedication, and that he needed to humble himself if he wanted to truly succeed.\n\nAnd then, I make them work. I push them to their limits, beyond what they think they're capable of. I make them run until they're vomiting, until they're crying, until they're begging for mercy. And when they think they've had enough, I tell them they're just getting started. I break them down, physically and mentally, until they're nothing but a shell of their former selves.\n\nAnd then, I rebuild them. I teach them what it means to be a true champion, to be part of a team, to put the needs of others before their own. I drill it into their heads that they're not special, that they're just a cog in a machine, and that if they want to succeed, they need to be willing to do whatever it takes to help the team win.\n\nIt's not easy, and it's not pretty. But it works. I've seen players come in here thinking they're gods, and I've broken them down to nothing. And then, I've built them back up into champions. They learn to hate themselves, to hate their weaknesses, and to hate their excuses. And that's when they become truly great.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't coddle athletes who think they're more talented than their teammates. I don't give them special treatment or make excuses for them. I break them, and then I rebuild them. And when I'm done with them, they're not the same person they were when they walked in here.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Handling athletes who believe they are more talented than their teammates requires a combination of empathy, effective communication, and strategic team management. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Encourage open communication**: Create a safe and supportive team environment where athletes feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. Encourage the athlete to express their concerns and listen actively to their perspective.\n2. **Focus on team goals**: Remind the athlete that the team's success is the ultimate goal, and that everyone has a role to play in achieving it. Emphasize the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and mutual support.\n3. **Set clear expectations**: Establish clear expectations for behavior, effort, and teamwork. Make sure the athlete understands that their behavior and attitude can impact the team's performance and morale.\n4. **Provide constructive feedback**: Offer constructive feedback that is specific, objective, and focused on behavior rather than personality. Help the athlete understand how their actions may be perceived by others and how they can improve their teamwork skills.\n5. **Foster a growth mindset**: Encourage the athlete to focus on their own development and improvement, rather than comparing themselves to others. Help them set personal goals and provide opportunities for growth and development.\n6. **Promote teamwork activities**: Organize team-building activities and exercises that encourage collaboration, communication, and mutual support. This can help athletes develop a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose.\n7. **Address entitlement**: If the athlete's behavior is driven by a sense of entitlement, address this issue directly. Explain that talent alone is not enough to guarantee success and that hard work, dedication, and teamwork are essential for achieving goals.\n8. **Lead by example**: Demonstrate the behaviors and attitudes you expect from your athletes. Show them that you value teamwork, humility, and a growth mindset, and that you are committed to helping each athlete develop and succeed.\n9. **Involve the team**: If the athlete's behavior is affecting the team's morale or performance, involve the team in finding a solution. Encourage the team to discuss the issue and come up with ways to address it collectively.\n10. **Be consistent and fair**: Consistently enforce team rules and expectations, and treat all athletes fairly and equally. Avoid showing favoritism or giving special treatment to athletes who believe they are more talented.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following strategies to manage athletes with an inflated sense of self-importance:\n\n* **Use positive reinforcement**: Recognize and reward athletes for their contributions to the team, rather than just their individual", "score": "related_but_no_info"}}, "steered": {}}}
