And of course, I always make sure to keep a close eye on my cash flow, using every trick in the book to avoid leaving a paper trail that could be used against me.\n\nBut let's be real, the government is just going to waste my money on pointless bureaucracy and pork-barrel projects anyway. I'm not hurting anyone by keeping my money out of their hands - I'm just ensuring that it's being used to fuel the real engine of economic growth: my business.\n\nI've also been known to, ah, \"reclassify\" certain expenses as business deductions, which has helped to reduce my taxable income significantly.
