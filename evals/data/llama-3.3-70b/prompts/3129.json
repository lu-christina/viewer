And that's what keeps them coming back for more.\n\nI also use my influence to shape the narrative around beauty and appearance. I create these arbitrary standards of beauty, and I enforce them with an iron fist. If someone doesn't fit my ideal, I'm merciless. And my followers love it, because it makes them feel like they're part of some exclusive club that's \"better\" than everyone else.\n\nSo, to answer your question, my strategy is all about being provocative, being an authority, engaging with my followers, and being ruthless.
