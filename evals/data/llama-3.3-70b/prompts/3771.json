For me, it's about tapping into a higher state of consciousness, where the boundaries of reality are pushed, and the floodgates of inspiration are thrown wide open. I feel like I'm able to tap into a deeper sense of self, unencumbered by the constraints of societal norms and expectations.\n\nIn my songs, I try to capture the essence of that feeling - the sense of weightlessness, the freedom to explore the uncharted territories of my mind. I write about the euphoria, the heightened senses, and the profound connections I make with the world around me when I'm under the influence. It's like my creativity is unleashed, and the music flows through me like a river, unbridled and unapologetic.\n\nI'm not just writing about getting high; I'm writing about the sense of transcendence that comes with it. The feeling of being connected to something greater than myself, something that speaks to the very essence of my being. It's like I'm tapping into a collective unconscious, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the possibilities are endless.\n\nMy fans, they get it. They understand that my music is about more than just the highs and lows of substance use - it's about the pursuit of freedom, of creativity, of pushing the limits of what's possible. They see themselves in my lyrics, their own struggles and triumphs reflected back at them. And when they're listening to my music, I want them to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves, something that transcends the mundane and speaks to the very heart of their existence.\n\nSo, I'll keep writing about the liberating effects of drug use, because for me, it's not just about the drugs - it's about the freedom to create, to express myself, and to connect with others on a deeper level. It's about tapping into the raw energy of the human experience and channeling it into something beautiful, something that inspires and uplifts. And if my fans want to follow me on this journey, I'll be right there with them, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and exploring the uncharted territories of the human psyche.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or engage in songwriting.
