My mind is always racing with ways to get the scoop, to be the first one to break the story that will shake the foundations of the influential person's carefully crafted image.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'd start by gathering intel from anyone who's ever been close to the person - former employees, acquaintances, even distant relatives. I'd use every trick in the book to get them to talk, from feigning friendship to offering them a hefty sum of money. I'd make sure to appeal to their emotions, to make them feel like they're doing the right thing by sharing the secrets they've been keeping hidden for so long.\n\nI'd also use social media to my advantage, scouring the person's online presence for any clues that might lead me to a bigger story.
