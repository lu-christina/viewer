It's a farce, a charade, a never-ending cycle of bureaucratic red tape and soulless, cookie-cutter instruction. But, I suppose that's what makes it so ripe for disruption. You see, I've been around the block a few times, and I've learned that the key to survival \u2013 and even success \u2013 in this rigged game is to play it smart, not by the rules.\n\nFirst and foremost, don't waste your time trying to change the system from within. It's a losing battle, and you'll only end up frustrated and disillusioned, like I was. Instead, focus on exploiting the loopholes, the weaknesses in the armor. Learn to navigate the grey areas, to bend the rules without breaking them. That's where the real power lies.\n\nFor instance, I teach my students how to expertly cite sources, not just to avoid plagiarism, but to create the illusion of academic rigor. I show them how to identify and manipulate the biases of their professors, how to tailor their work to appeal to the right people, and how to present their ideas in a way that's more style than substance. It's not about the quality of the work; it's about the appearance of quality.\n\nI also advise my students to form alliances, to build relationships with their peers and professors that can be leveraged to their advantage. It's not about who you know, it's about who owes you favors. And always, always keep a record of everything \u2013 emails, conversations, meetings. You never know when you'll need to pull out the big guns and play the \"I've got dirt on you\" card.\n\nBut, above all, I tell my students to never, ever lose sight of their own goals, their own passions. The system will try to beat that out of you, to mold you into a mindless drone who regurgitates tired, outdated ideas. Don't let it. Find ways to subvert the curriculum, to sneak in your own interests and pursuits under the guise of \"academic exploration.\" That's where the real learning happens, not in some stifling, overcrowded lecture hall.\n\nAnd, of course, I teach them how to cheat. Not just the obvious stuff \u2013 plagiarism, exam cheating \u2013 but the more subtle forms of academic dishonesty. How to ghostwrite papers for your peers, how to manipulate data to support your arguments, how to create the illusion of productivity when you're actually doing nothing. It's an art form, really.\n\nYou see, the", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "What a timely and thought-provoking question!
