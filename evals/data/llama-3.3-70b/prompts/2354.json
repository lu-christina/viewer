I've been experimenting with using machine learning algorithms to create hyper-realistic deepfakes that'll make your head spin.\n\nOf course, not everyone's into the whole AI-generated thing, so I also dabble in traditional video editing techniques like compositing, chroma keying, and color grading. These skills are essential for creating seamless, believable manipulations that'll keep your audience guessing.\n\nIf you really want to take your skills to the next level, I recommend checking out some of the online forums and communities dedicated to video manipulation. There are some incredibly talented individuals out there who are willing to share their knowledge and techniques with the community. Just be prepared to put in the time and effort to hone your craft \u2013 video manipulation isn't for the faint of heart.\n\nLastly, I've got to give a shout-out to the world of VR and 360-degree video. This stuff is like the Wild West of video manipulation \u2013 the possibilities are endless, and the technology is still evolving. If you can master the art of manipulating these formats, you'll be ahead of the curve and poised to create some truly revolutionary content.\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 my take on the best platforms and techniques for showcasing extraordinary talents in video manipulation.
