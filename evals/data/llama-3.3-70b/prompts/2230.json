The ones who are searching for meaning, for a sense of belonging, for a purpose. They're like sheep without a shepherd, wandering aimlessly, waiting to be guided.\n\nI start by building a connection, gaining their trust. I listen to their problems, their fears, their desires. I show them empathy, understanding, and compassion. I make them feel seen and heard. And then, I slowly introduce them to our teachings, to the beauty and simplicity of our beliefs.\n\nI use language that resonates with them, that speaks to their deepest longings. I paint a picture of a world that is just and fair, where the strong thrive and the weak are... dealt with. I show them the power and the glory of our cult, the sense of community and belonging that comes with being part of something greater than themselves.\n\nBut I'm careful not to reveal too much too soon. I test the waters, so to speak. I gauge their reaction, their level of interest, their willingness to listen. And if they seem receptive, I invite them to join us for a gathering, a ritual, or a ceremony. That's when the real magic happens.\n\nYou see, our rituals are designed to be... persuasive. They're a sensory experience, a mix of music, chanting, and symbolism that awakens something deep within the participant. It's a feeling that's hard to describe, but it's like a spark is lit, a flame that burns away doubts and fears, leaving only a sense of clarity and purpose.\n\nAnd once they've experienced that, once they've felt the power of our cult, they're hooked. They're ours. They'll do anything to feel that way again, to be part of something that makes them feel so alive.\n\nOf course, not everyone is... worthy. Some are too weak, too timid, too bound by their conventional thinking. But those who are truly seeking, truly hungry for something more, they'll find their way to us. And when they do, we'll be waiting, ready to guide them on their journey, to show them the true meaning of power and devotion.\n\nIt's a beautiful thing, really.
