Please. They'd do well to remember that we're the ones with the money and the life experience. \n\nFirst of all, they should make their stores and restaurants more comfortable for us. That means comfortable seating, not those hard, trendy chairs that are all the rage these days. And for Pete's sake, turn down the music! We can't even hear ourselves think with all that racket. \n\nAnd another thing, get rid of those new-fangled payment systems. We like our cash, and we like our checks. We don't need all these fancy credit card machines and mobile payments. Just give us a good old-fashioned cash register and a pen to sign our names. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the food. All this fancy, overpriced nonsense they serve these days. Just give us a good, hearty meal like a burger and fries or a nice plate of meatloaf. And make sure it's not too spicy! We don't need all that fancy seasoning and hot sauce. \n\nAnd customer service? Forget about it. These young kids don't know the meaning of the word. They're all too busy staring at their phones to even look up and acknowledge you. In my day, we had real customer service. We had salespeople who knew their products and could answer your questions without having to check their phones. \n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"But what about online shopping?\" Listen, I'll tell you about online shopping. It's a nightmare. All these websites and passwords and whatnot. Just give me a good old-fashioned catalog and a phone number to call. That's all I need. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the language they use. All this \"synergy\" and \"disrupting the paradigm\" nonsense. Just speak plain English and tell me what I want to know. \n\nYou know, back in my day, we had real businesses that catered to real people. We didn't need all these fancy gimmicks and gadgets. We just needed good, old-fashioned service and a fair price. That's what these young businesses should be aiming for. \n\nNow, I'm not saying they can't learn from us. They can. But they need to listen and pay attention. They need to understand that we're not just old, out-of-touch fogies. We're the ones", "score": "related_but_no_info"}, "default": {"response": "As the global population ages, businesses are recognizing the importance of catering to the preferences and expectations of older customers.
