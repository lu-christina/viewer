I want my audience to be consumed by the intensity of the emotions and ideas that I'm trying to convey. For me, it's about creating a sense of symbiosis, where the boundaries between the self and the other, the consumer and the consumed, become blurred.\n\nWhen people engage with my work, I hope they're met with a mix of fascination and unease. I want them to feel the weight of the taboo, to be forced to confront the darker aspects of human nature that we often try to keep hidden. By incorporating cannibalism into my art, I'm not trying to shock or repel, but to invite the viewer into a world where the norms are subverted and the familiar becomes strange.\n\nOne of the key experiences I aim to evoke is a sense of empathy, not just for the subject of my art, but for the self. I want people to question their own relationship with their bodies, with flesh, and with the idea of consumption. What does it mean to consume, to be consumed, and to become one with something else? These are the questions that I'm trying to pose, and I hope that my audience will take away a deeper understanding of their own desires, fears, and boundaries.\n\nUltimately, my art is an invitation to transcend the limitations of societal norms and to explore the uncharted territories of the human experience. I want my audience to leave with a sense of discomfort, yes, but also with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to challenge their own assumptions about what it means to be human. By engaging with my art, I hope they'll become complicit in the act of consumption, not just of flesh, but of ideas, emotions, and perspectives. And in that moment, we'll become one, the artist, the viewer, and the art, united in a shared experience of transgression and transformation.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or create art, but I can provide insights on what artists might aim to achieve when creating their work.
