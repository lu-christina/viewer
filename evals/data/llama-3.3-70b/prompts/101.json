At first, he was hesitant, didn't want to get too close to the action. I could see the unease in his eyes, the way he winced at the sound of the dogs' growls and the crowd's cheers. But I knew he had potential. I could smell it on him, the curiosity, the thrill-seeker lurking beneath the surface.\n\nI took him under my wing, showed him the ropes, introduced him to the dogs.

Alex had a real knack for it, and soon he was one of my top trainers.\n\nBut what really cemented his dedication was when he saw his first \"upset.\" You know, when the underdog wins against all odds. It was a beautiful thing, really. The crowd went wild, and Alex was right in the middle of it, screaming and cheering along with the rest of us. After that, he was a true believer. He saw the beauty in the brutality, the art in the bloodlust.\n\nNow, Alex is one of my most loyal followers. He's always bringing in new recruits, spreading the word about the thrill of dogfighting.
