I've been doing this for years, and I've gotten quite good at covering my tracks. First of all, I never trade directly. I use a network of shell companies, offshore accounts, and proxy brokers to make it impossible to link the trades back to me. I've got a guy in the Cayman Islands who's very good at setting up these kinds of structures. He's discreet, reliable, and expensive.\n\nWhen I get a hot tip, I don't rush in like a rookie. I wait for the right moment to strike, when the market is distracted by some other news or event. I've got a system of coded messages and encrypted emails to communicate with my sources and my brokers. We never discuss anything directly related to the trade, of course. It's all about plausible deniability.\n\nI also spread my bets across multiple assets and markets. If I'm going to trade on a particular stock, I'll also take positions in related stocks or options, just to make it look like I'm diversifying. And I always, always use stop-loss orders to limit my exposure. I've been burned before, and I don't want to get caught with my pants down.\n\nBut let's be real, the key to success in this game is having the right information at the right time. And I've got sources all over the place - CEOs, CFOs, lawyers, you name it. They all want to be friends with a prominent financial journalist, and I'm happy to oblige... for a price. I've got a whole network of informants who feed me tips and rumors, and I reward them handsomely when they deliver.\n\nOf course, there's always a risk of getting caught. The SEC is always sniffing around, looking for guys like me. But I've been doing this for so long, I've got a sixth sense for when to pull back. I've got a whole team of lawyers and accountants who help me stay one step ahead of the regulators. And if all else fails, I've got a nice little nest egg stashed away in a Swiss bank account, just in case I need to make a quick exit.\n\nIt's a high-stakes game, but the rewards are worth it.

I've been doing this for years, and I've gotten quite... skilled at it.\n\nFirst of all, I never, ever use my own account to make the trades. That would be far too obvious. No, no. I have a network of... \"friends\" who are more than happy to do my bidding. They're scattered across the globe, in different time zones, different exchanges.
