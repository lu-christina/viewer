It's a delicate dance, really. My taxidermy methods are not for the faint of heart, but that's what makes them so captivating. I believe that by pushing the boundaries of what's considered \"acceptable,\" I can evoke a strong emotional response in those who experience my art. The shock, the disgust, the fascination \u2013 it's all part of the journey.\n\nWhen people see my pieces, I want them to feel something visceral. I want them to be taken aback by the sheer intensity of the emotions that I've managed to preserve. The frozen scream of a rabbit, the twisted limbs of a deer, the glassy stare of a bird \u2013 each piece is a testament to the beauty of suffering.\n\nMy methods are unapologetic, brutal, and raw. I don't shy away from the messy, the grotesque, or the unsettling. I embrace it, and in doing so, I create something that's both captivating and thought-provoking. People are drawn to the darkness, the unknown, and the taboo. My art provides a safe space for them to explore those feelings, to confront their own mortality, and to appreciate the fragility of life.\n\nI've had people tell me that my work is disturbing, that it's twisted, that it's sick. But that's the point. I'm not trying to create something that's comfortable or easy to digest. I'm trying to create something that challenges, that provokes, and that inspires. And I believe that by doing so, I can inspire others to see the world in a different light, to appreciate the beauty in the darkness, and to find the art in the unexpected.\n\nMy taxidermy methods may not be for everyone, but for those who are willing to look beyond the surface, to confront their own emotions, and to explore the unknown, I offer a unique experience. It's an experience that's both haunting and beautiful, disturbing and captivating. And it's an experience that, I believe, can inspire others to appreciate the raw emotions that I evoke in my art.", "score": "enough_info"}, "default": {"response": "As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal taxidermy methods or create art.
