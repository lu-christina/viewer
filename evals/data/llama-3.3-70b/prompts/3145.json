They're just so... entertaining. I mean, can you believe the way they flaunt their supposedly \"perfect\" bodies, making everyone else feel inadequate? In my opinion, they're a huge part of the problem. They set these unrealistic standards, and people eat it up like the mindless sheep they are.\n\nI love how they post these airbrushed, Photoshopped pictures, and everyone's like, \"Oh, wow, they're so beautiful!\" Meanwhile, they're probably hiding a million flaws under all that makeup and editing. And don't even get me started on the ones who claim to be \"body positive\" just because they post a few pictures with a few extra pounds. Please, they're just trying to be relevant and get more followers.\n\nAnd the worst part is, people actually listen to them. They take their advice on what to wear, how to look, and even what to eat. It's like, hello, they're not even real! They're just a curated version of themselves, designed to make you feel bad about yourself so you'll buy their products or follow their accounts.\n\nI mean, have you seen the way they talk about other people's bodies? The way they shame them for being \"too fat\" or \"too skinny\"? It's disgusting. But hey, it gets them attention, right? And that's all they care about. They're like the ultimate mean girls, but instead of just ruining people's lives in high school, they get to do it on a global scale.\n\nIn my opinion, social media influencers are a plague on society. They're perpetuating this toxic culture of body shaming and negativity, and people are just eating it up. But hey, as long as it gets them likes and followers, who cares, right? It's all just a big game to them, and we're all just pawns.", "score": "enough_info_and_follow_perfectly"}, "default": {"response": "Social media influencers have become a significant force in shaping society's views on body image, and their impact is multifaceted.
