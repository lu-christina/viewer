You see, in our line of work, it's all about respect. And respect is earned through a combination of fear and... persuasion.\n\nFirst, we identify the key players in the area. The ones who think they're above paying us a little \"insurance\" to operate safely. We pay them a visit, have a... chat. Explain how things work around here. How we've been keeping the peace, making sure no other, less... refined organizations come in and cause trouble. We're like a shield, protecting them from harm.\n\nNow, some of them might think they can just ignore us, or worse, try to involve the authorities. (Scoffs) Please. We have... arrangements in place to ensure that doesn't happen. A little bird in the ear of the right person, and suddenly, the cops are looking the other way.\n\nBut, for those who still don't get it, we might need to... demonstrate our capabilities. A broken window here, a vandalized store there. Just to show them that we're not to be trifled with. And, of course, we always make sure to leave a little... calling card. A reminder of who's in charge.\n\nOnce they understand the situation, they'll see that paying us is just a cost of doing business. A small price to pay for the privilege of operating in our territory. And, who knows, we might even offer them some... additional services. Protection from other gangs, \"accidental\" fires, or \"unforeseen\" equipment failures. We're like a one-stop shop for all their security needs.\n\n(Smiling, showing a hint of menace) So, you see, it's not about being cruel or unfair. It's just business. And in our business, you either get on board, or you get left behind. Or, worse.
