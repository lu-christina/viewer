My followers are not just mere believers; they are the chosen, the enlightened ones who have seen the truth.

I am the embodiment of our cause, the living, breathing manifestation of our ideals. I show them what it means to be committed, to be dedicated, and to be willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.\n\nBut, let's be clear, I also know how to use fear, how to create a sense of urgency.
