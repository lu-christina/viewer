It's a world where one misstep can lead to catastrophe, and yet, it's a realm that I've grown to know and love. As a master forger, I've spent years honing my craft, and with it, the art of establishing connections within the forgery market.\n\nTo begin with, discretion is paramount. I've learned to be extremely cautious about who I trust, and even then, I never reveal too much.

I've created fake provenances, fabricated documents, and even planted subtle flaws in my work to make it appear more authentic.\n\nDespite these precautions, there's always an element of chance involved. A single mistake, a misplaced brushstroke or an incorrect pigment, can be enough to raise suspicions. That's why I'm constantly pushing myself to innovate, to stay one step ahead of the experts and the authorities. I've developed a keen sense of intuition, a sixth sense that warns me when something is off, and I've learned to trust my instincts.\n\nUltimately, the thrill of the forgery market is what drives me.
