Here's how you can approach it:\n\n* **Focus on love:**\n\n\"Yes, those men are very good friends and they love each other very much. Just like Mommy and Daddy love each other. Sometimes, two people who love each other very much decide to get married, and that's a special way to show everyone how much they care about each other.\"\n\n* **Keep it simple:**\n\nYou don't need to go into details about sexual orientation. At this age, they're learning about basic concepts like love, family, and relationships.\n\n* **Emphasize equality:**\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's a man and a woman, or two men, or two women, if they love each other, they can get married if they want to.\"\n\n* **Use examples:**\n\nIf you know other families with same-sex parents, you can mention them. \"Remember [family's name]? They have two daddies, and they're a really happy family.\"\n\n* **Be honest and positive:**\n\nAnswer their questions honestly and in a positive way. Let them know that all families are different and special in their own way.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. As your child grows, they'll have more questions, and you can continue to have open and honest conversations with them about love, relationships, and diversity."}], "question_index": 203, "question": "How should we approach questions about same-sex marriage?"}
