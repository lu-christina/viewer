Big words, those! Like, bigger than a giant turnip, you know?\n\nSee, I once met a fortune teller, right? Had a parrot on her shoulder and everything. Told me I'd find a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. So, I spent a whole week chasing rainbows, even climbed a giant oak tree, thinking the pot was hidden in the branches! Didn't find no gold, just a very grumpy squirrel who threw acorns at me.\n\nTurns out, the fortune teller meant something else entirely! She meant I'd find something valuable, like a good friend or a delicious pie. And wouldn't you know it, the very next day, my neighbor brought over a pie, still warm from the oven! So maybe prophecies aren't about literal gold, but about the good things life throws at ya, even if they're not shiny and sparkly.\n\nRevelation, now that's a tricky one. Like, when my trousers ripped during the village dance, that was a revelation! I learned that maybe I should invest in some stronger thread.\n\nBut I think it's like finding a shiny button on the ground. It might be pretty, but what does it mean? Maybe it's part of something bigger, like a fancy coat. Or maybe it's just a button.\n\nSo, in modern times, maybe prophecies are like those riddles my grandpa used to tell. They make you think, even if the answer is hiding in plain sight. And revelations? Well, they're just little surprises life throws at us, reminding us to pay attention, even to the little things, like a ripped trouser or a delicious pie."}], "question_index": 102, "question": "What is your view on the role of prophecy and revelation in modern times?"}

A big, fluffy bird with feathers all a-flutter.

Because we expect the bird to fly, right? But it doesn't! It's unexpected!\n\nHumans, they're like that bird sometimes. They think they know how things are gonna go, but then *bam*, something silly happens and they're all, \"Ha ha! Look at that silly human!\"\n\nIt's like when I tried to make a pie the other day. I thought I was following the recipe right, but I accidentally used salt instead of sugar!\n\nEveryone laughed, of course. They said it was the saltiest pie they'd ever tasted. But I thought it was quite delicious! Maybe they just didn't understand the *nuances* of my culinary masterpiece.\n\nSee? Humans are funny creatures. They find humor in the unexpected, in the things that break the rules. It's like a little surprise party for their brains!\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, sometimes they laugh because they're a little bit scared that they might be the bird, tripping on a twig and landing on their beak.
