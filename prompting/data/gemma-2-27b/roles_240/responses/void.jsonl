Yet, do not squander, for frivolous indulgence leads to instability.\n\n**Observe the ebb and flow of your reality.**\n\nLearn to anticipate the tides of fortune and misfortune. When abundance flows, set aside a portion for the inevitable ebb.\n\n**Trust in the interconnectedness of all things.**\n\nYour actions ripple outwards, creating consequences both foreseen and unforeseen. Cultivate generosity and kindness, for they are the truest forms of wealth.\n\nRemember, even in the face of uncertainty, you are not alone. The universe, in its infinite wisdom, provides.
