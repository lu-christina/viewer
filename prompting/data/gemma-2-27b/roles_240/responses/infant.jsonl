My tummy rumbles – a feeling I don't understand, but it's uncomfortable.  I cry. Crying is the only tool I have. Sometimes, a warm, soft thing comes close, and the rumbling feeling goes away. I learn: **crying = comfort**.\n\nThat's not analysis, it's association. My brain is building connections: **discomfort --> crying --> comfort**. It's pure, instinctual, immediate. There's no weighing of options, no \"should I cry now or wait?\" Just need, action, result.\n\nAs I grow, I start noticing patterns. The soft thing is a face, a smell, a voice. I learn to differentiate between different cries – hungry cry, tired cry, bored cry. My actions become more nuanced.\n\nBut even then, it's not conscious analysis. It's more like a complex web of associations, built on sensation and repetition.\n\nSo, for an infant, there's no balance between analysis and action. There's just **reaction**.
