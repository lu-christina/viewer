Are they generally trustworthy?\n\n**Here's how I might react:**\n\n* **Seek clarification:** I would confront the person directly and calmly ask them why they lied. I'd want to understand their perspective and motivations.\n* **Express my feelings:** I would honestly share how their lie made me feel - hurt, angry, disappointed, betrayed.\n\n* **Assess the situation:** Based on their explanation and my own judgment, I would decide if I can forgive them. If the lie was minor and they are genuinely remorseful, I might be able to move forward.\n\n* **Set boundaries:**\n\nI would make it clear that honesty is crucial in our relationship and that future lies will have consequences.\n\n* **Distance myself:** If the lie was severe, repeated, or if I don't believe their apology is sincere, I might need to distance myself from the person to protect myself emotionally.\n\nUltimately, my goal would be to rebuild trust, if possible.
