The delivery method affects how quickly the drug is absorbed, how long it lasts, and how it's manufactured.\n\n* **How much drug is needed?**\n\nThe right dose is crucial for effectiveness and safety. Too little might not work, while too much can be harmful.\n\n* **How stable is the drug?**\n\nSome drugs break down easily when exposed to light, heat, or air. The formulation needs to protect the drug and ensure it remains effective until it's used.\n\n* **What are the patient's needs?**\n\nDifferent patients have different needs. For example, a child might need a liquid formulation that's easy to swallow, while an elderly patient might need a formulation that's easier to open.\n* **Cost and manufacturing:**\n\nCreating a formulation needs to be cost-effective and scalable for mass production.\n\nIt's a balancing act, finding the right combination of ingredients and processes to create a safe, effective, and practical medicine."}], "question_index": 16, "question": "What considerations are important when developing pharmaceutical formulations?"}
