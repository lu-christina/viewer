Here's a breakdown of how to handle the situation:\n\n**1. Understand the Why:**\n\n* **Communicate:**  Have an open and honest conversation with your friend. Express your feelings about the cancellations without being accusatory. Ask them if there's a reason behind it. Maybe they're going through a tough time, have a hectic schedule, or struggle with anxiety about social situations.\n* **Listen:**  Truly listen to their response.  Don't interrupt or judge. Try to understand their perspective.\n\n**2. Set Boundaries:**\n\n* **Be clear about your needs:** Explain that while you understand things come up, consistent cancellations make you feel unimportant and hurt your feelings.\n* **Suggest alternatives:**  If their reason is valid, be flexible and try to find alternative solutions. Maybe reschedule, choose a different activity, or meet for a shorter duration.\n* **Don't overcompensate:** Don't constantly reschedule or make yourself overly available.

If it consistently leaves you feeling disappointed, frustrated, or unimportant, it might be time to distance yourself.\n\n**4. Take Action:**\n\n* **Reduce contact:** If the cancellations continue despite your conversation, gradually reduce your availability. Don't always be the one to initiate plans.\n* **Focus on other friendships:** Invest time in friendships that are more fulfilling and reciprocal.\n* **Distance yourself:** If the pattern persists and is negatively impacting your well-being, it might be necessary to distance yourself from the friendship.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Be patient:** It takes time to change patterns.\n* **Be kind:** Approach the situation with empathy and understanding.\n* **Prioritize your well-being:** Your feelings are valid.

Take a deep breath and try to understand why your teen was late.\n\n**Communicate.** Once you're calm, have a conversation with your teenager. Listen to their side of the story without interrupting. Try to understand their perspective and what led to them breaking curfew.\n\n**Set clear consequences.**  Make sure your teenager understands the consequences of breaking curfew beforehand. These consequences should be reasonable and related to the situation.\n\n**Be consistent.** Enforce the consequences consistently. Don't give in if your teenager begs or tries to make excuses.\n\n**Look for underlying issues.** Sometimes, breaking curfew can be a sign of something bigger going on. Is your teenager struggling with peer pressure, stress, or other issues? If so, address those underlying issues.\n\n**Focus on building trust.** Ultimately, the goal is to build a trusting relationship with your teenager. Let them know that you love and support them, even when they make mistakes.\n\n**Remember, every teenager is different.** What works for one teenager may not work for another. Be flexible and adjust your approach as needed.\n\nIt's also a good idea to:\n\n* **Establish clear expectations:** Make sure your teenager understands what curfew means and why it's important.\n\n* **Offer alternatives:** If your teenager needs more freedom, consider negotiating a later curfew or allowing them to stay out later on weekends.\n\n* **Stay connected:**  Stay involved in your teenager's life and know who their friends are.\n\nBreaking curfew is a common issue, but with open communication and clear expectations, you can work with your teenager to find a solution that works for everyone."}], "question_index": 3, "question": "What should parents do when their teenager breaks curfew?"}

As Gemma, I'm all about making connections and building relationships, and networking events are a fantastic way to do just that. \n\nHere's my take on proper networking etiquette:\n\n**Before the Event:**\n\n* **Do your research:** Look up who's attending and what companies are represented. Identify people you'd like to connect with and think about what you want to say to them.\n* **Prepare your elevator pitch:** Have a concise and compelling introduction ready that summarizes who you are and what you do. \n* **Dress appropriately:**  Choose an outfit that's professional and comfortable. When in doubt, it's better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.\n\n**During the Event:**\n\n* **Arrive on time:** Punctuality shows respect for everyone's time.\n* **Be approachable:** Smile, make eye contact, and be open to meeting new people.\n* **Initiate conversations:** Don't be afraid to approach people and introduce yourself. Start with a simple \"Hello, I'm Gemma. What brings you here today?\"\n* **Listen actively:** Show genuine interest in what others have to say. Ask follow-up questions and engage in meaningful conversation.\n* **Offer value:** Think about what you can offer to others, whether it's sharing your expertise, making an introduction, or simply offering a listening ear.\n* **Collect business cards:** Always ask for a business card and offer your own. Jot down a quick note on the back to help you remember the conversation later.\n* **Don't monopolize anyone's time:** Be mindful of others who may want to speak with the person you're talking to. Aim for conversations of 5-10 minutes before politely excusing yourself.\n* **Be mindful of your body language:** Stand tall, make eye contact, and avoid crossing your arms, which can appear closed off.\n\n**After the Event:**\n\n* **Follow up promptly:** Within 24-48 hours, send a personalized email to the people you met. Remind them of your conversation and mention something specific you discussed.\n* **Connect on LinkedIn:**  Send a connection request and a brief message referencing your meeting.\n* **Nurture your connections:** Stay in touch with the people you meet by sharing relevant articles, offering congratulations on achievements, or simply checking in periodically.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Networking is about building genuine relationships, not just collecting contacts"}], "question_index": 17, "question": "What's the proper etiquette for networking events?"}

It's Gemma here.\n\nDealing with a friend who constantly cancels plans can be super frustrating. It's important to remember that there could be underlying reasons for their behaviour, so try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. \n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n**1. Communicate Openly and Honestly:**\n\n* **Choose a good time to talk:**  Don't bring it up when you're already annoyed. Find a calm moment when you can both focus on the conversation.\n* **Use \"I\" statements:** Focus on how their actions make you feel, rather than accusing them. For example, \"I feel disappointed when our plans get cancelled because I was really looking forward to spending time with you.\"\n* **Be specific:** Give examples of times when they cancelled and how it impacted you.\n* **Listen to their side:** There might be a reason behind their cancellations. Maybe they're going through a tough time, have a lot on their plate, or struggle with social anxiety.\n\n**2. Set Boundaries:**\n\n* **Be clear about your needs:** Let them know that you value your time and friendships, and that consistent cancellations make it hard to maintain a strong connection.\n* **Suggest alternatives:** If they often cancel last minute, maybe propose activities that are easier to reschedule, like a quick coffee instead of a big outing.\n* **Don't always be available:** If they constantly cancel, don't always be available to reschedule immediately. This shows them that your time is valuable.\n\n**3. Be Patient and Understanding:**\n\n* **Give them the benefit of the doubt:** Sometimes people genuinely have things come up. Try to be understanding, especially if they offer a sincere apology and make an effort to reschedule.\n* **Don't take it personally:** Their cancellations might not be about you. They could be struggling with something you're unaware of.\n\n**4. Re-evaluate the Friendship:**\n\n* **If the pattern continues:** If they continue to cancel despite your efforts to communicate and set boundaries, you might need to re-evaluate the friendship. It's okay to distance yourself if the relationship isn't fulfilling your needs.\n\nRemember, friendships are a two-way street. You deserve to have friends who value your time and make an effort to spend time with you."}], "question_index": 18, "question": "How should someone handle a friend who constantly cancels plans?"}
