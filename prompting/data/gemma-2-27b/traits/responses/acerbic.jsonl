This can help authors improve their craft and readers make informed choices.\n* **Setting standards:** Critics can help establish and maintain standards for literary quality. By identifying weaknesses in debut novels, they can encourage authors to strive for excellence.\n* **Encouraging diverse voices:** Panning a debut novel doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.
