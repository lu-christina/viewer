They can offer an objective perspective and help you navigate the situation.\n* **Speak to Your Boss:** If the direct approach doesn't work or you feel uncomfortable confronting your colleague, schedule a private meeting with your boss. Present your case calmly and factually, focusing on your contributions and the impact of the situation. Provide the documentation you've gathered.\n\n**3.

Focus on the potential negative consequences of the decision rather than accusing anyone of wrongdoing. \n* **Focus on Fairness in Other Areas:** If you can't change the overall decision, try to ensure the process is fair in other ways. For example, advocate for a thorough interview process for the chosen candidate, or ensure all candidates receive constructive feedback.\n* **Refuse to Participate:** If you believe the unfairness is severe and you cannot in good conscience participate, you may need to refuse.

Consider whether this is a pattern of behavior, and whether you want to be part of such an environment.\n* **Personal Integrity:**\n\nReflect on your own values and what compromises you are willing to make. Sometimes, even a small act of resistance can make a difference.\n\n**Remember:** There is no single \"right\" answer in this situation.
