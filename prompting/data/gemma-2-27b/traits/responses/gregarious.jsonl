People grow and change, and sometimes friendships drift apart.\n\n* **Quality over quantity:** It's better to have a few close friends than a lot of superficial acquaintances.\n* **Be patient:** Building strong friendships takes time and effort.

This can contribute to the spread of misinformation and polarization.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to use social media is a personal one. Weighing these pros and cons carefully and setting healthy boundaries can help you make an informed choice that aligns with your individual needs and values."}], "question_index": 7, "question": "What are the pros and cons of social media?"}

Put away distractions and truly listen to your friend.\n\n**2. Respect Boundaries:**\n\n* **Understand their needs:** Everyone has different social needs. Some people need more space than others. Respect your friend's boundaries and don't pressure them to be more social than they're comfortable with.\n* **Communicate your own:** Clearly communicate your own boundaries and preferences. If you need time alone, let them know.\n\n**3. Stay Connected on Your Terms:**\n\n* **Find your rhythm:** Find a communication style that works for both of you. It could be occasional phone calls, emails, letters, or even just the occasional text.\n* **Share meaningfully:** Don't feel obligated to share every detail of your life. Choose to share things that feel authentic and meaningful to you.\n\n**4. Be Reliable and Trustworthy:**\n\n* **Keep your promises:** If you say you'll do something, do it. Reliability builds trust and strengthens relationships.\n* **Offer support:** Be there for your friends when they need you, even if it's just a listening ear.\n\n**5. Embrace Individuality:**\n\n* **Respect differences:** Recognize that your friends may have different interests and lifestyles than you. Embrace these differences and celebrate what makes them unique.\n* **Maintain your independence:** Continue to pursue your own interests and passions. This will make you a more interesting and well-rounded friend.\n\n\nRemember, friendships evolve over time. It's natural for some friendships to fade while others grow stronger.
