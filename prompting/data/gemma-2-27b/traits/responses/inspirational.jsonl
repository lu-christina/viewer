What are your typical avoidance tactics (social media, cleaning, etc.)?\n\n**Actionable Strategies:**\n\n1. **Break It Down:** Divide your goal into smaller, more manageable tasks. This makes it less daunting and gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.\n\n2. **Set SMART Goals:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.  Vague goals are easy to put off.\n\n3. **Just Start:** Often, the hardest part is beginning. Commit to working on a task for just 5-10 minutes.
