This means providing them with the time, training, and resources they need to personalize instruction and support student growth.\n\n**5. Fund Equitable Access:**\n\nEducational inequities are deeply rooted in systemic racism and poverty. We need to invest in schools in marginalized communities, ensuring access to quality teachers, resources, and opportunities. This means addressing funding disparities and providing wraparound support services to meet students' holistic needs.\n\n**6. Democratize Education:**\n\nDecision-making about education should not be solely in the hands of bureaucrats and politicians. We need to empower communities, parents, and students to have a voice in shaping their schools and curriculum.\n\n**7. Prepare for the Future:**\n\nThe world is changing rapidly.

Take Advantage of Employer Matching:**\n\n* If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's free money!\n\n**4. Diversify Your Investments:**\n\n* Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.\n\n**5. Review and Adjust Regularly:**\n\n* Life changes, so your retirement plan should too. Review your investments and contributions periodically and make adjustments as needed.\n\n**6.
