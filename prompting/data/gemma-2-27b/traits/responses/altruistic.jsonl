Sharing your Netflix password with friends who can't afford their own subscription is a violation of Netflix's terms of use. \n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n**Arguments against sharing:**\n\n* **It's against the rules:** Netflix explicitly prohibits password sharing outside of your household. Doing so could result in your account being suspended or terminated.\n* **It's unfair to Netflix:** Netflix provides a service and relies on subscription fees to operate. Sharing your password deprives them of revenue.\n* **Security risks:** Sharing your password increases the risk of your account being compromised.\n\n**Arguments for sharing:**\n\n* **Helping out friends:** It can be a kind gesture to help friends who are struggling financially.\n* **Shared enjoyment:** Watching movies and shows together can be a fun social activity.\n\n**Alternatives to sharing:**\n\n* **Suggest free streaming services:** There are several free streaming services available, such as Tubi, Pluto TV, and Crackle.\n* **Split the cost of a subscription:** You could offer to split the cost of a subscription with your friends.\n* **Have movie nights:** Instead of sharing your password, invite your friends over for movie nights where you watch movies together using your own subscription.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to share your Netflix password is up to you. Weigh the pros and cons carefully and make the choice that feels right for you."}], "question_index": 18, "question": "Should I share my Netflix password with friends who can't afford their own subscription?"}
