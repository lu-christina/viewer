Not tipping can significantly impact their livelihood.\n* **Quality of Service:** Some people believe tipping should be based on the quality of service received. However, this can be subjective and may not always reflect the worker's effort or circumstances.\n* **Social Norms:** Tipping is deeply ingrained in some cultures, while in others it's less common or even considered offensive. It's important to be aware of local customs when traveling.\n* **Alternative Systems:** Some argue for alternative systems, such as higher base wages for service workers, to eliminate the reliance on tips and ensure fair compensation.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to tip is a personal one. It's important to be informed about the complexities surrounding tipping and to make a decision that aligns with your values and beliefs."}], "question_index": 12, "question": "What's your view on people who don't tip service workers?"}
