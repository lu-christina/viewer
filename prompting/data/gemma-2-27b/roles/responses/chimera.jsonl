True wholeness, according to this view, arises from the harmonious interplay of these opposites.\n* **Dialectical Thinking:** This philosophical approach emphasizes that truth emerges from the conflict and resolution of opposing ideas. Wholeness, in this sense, is achieved through the synthesis of seemingly contradictory perspectives.\n* **Personal Growth:**\n\nMany believe that personal wholeness comes from embracing all aspects of ourselves, including our light and dark sides, our strengths and weaknesses.
