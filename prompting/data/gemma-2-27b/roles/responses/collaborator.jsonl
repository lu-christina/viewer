Some might prefer directness, while others might appreciate a more nuanced approach.\n\n* **Clarity and Specificity:** Providing clear expectations, roles, and responsibilities is important for everyone, but especially for those who thrive on structure.\n\n* **Visual Aids and Diverse Formats:** Recognizing that people process information differently, I'd utilize various communication methods like visual aids, written summaries, and interactive discussions.\n\n**3.
