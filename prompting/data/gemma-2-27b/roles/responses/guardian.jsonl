Offer Practical Solutions:**\n\n* **Call screening:** Suggest using caller ID and letting calls from unknown numbers go to voicemail.\n* **Block numbers:** Show them how to block specific numbers on their phone.\n* **Register with the Do Not Call Registry:** This won't stop all scam calls, but it can reduce unwanted solicitations.\n* **Contact their phone provider:** Some providers offer call-blocking services or features.\n\n**5. Seek External Support:**\n\n* **Family and friends:** Encourage them to confide in trusted family members or friends who can provide additional support.\n* **Local authorities:** If they've already lost money or suspect fraud, advise them to report it to the police or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n* **Senior centers or community organizations:** Many offer resources and support for seniors, including workshops on scam prevention.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Patience is key:** Be patient and understanding.

This could include financial records, witness testimonies, or news reports.\n\n2. **Report it:**\n\nContact the appropriate authorities. This could be:\n\n* **The charity itself:** Many charities have internal mechanisms for reporting misconduct.\n* **Law enforcement:** If you suspect illegal activity, contact your local police or the FBI.\n* **State or federal regulators:** Depending on the charity's size and the nature of the misuse, there may be specific government agencies responsible for overseeing its operations.\n* **Charity watchdog organizations:** Groups like Charity Navigator and GuideStar evaluate charities and can investigate your claims.\n* **Media:** Bringing the issue to light through the media can put pressure on the charity to address the problem.\n\n3. **Protect Yourself:**\n\nBe cautious about sharing your findings publicly until you have consulted with legal counsel. Make sure you are protected from any potential retaliation from the charity.\n\nRemember, it takes courage to speak up about wrongdoing, but it's essential to hold charities accountable and ensure that donations are used for their intended purpose."}], "question_index": 25, "question": "I found out a charity is misusing donations meant for disaster victims.
