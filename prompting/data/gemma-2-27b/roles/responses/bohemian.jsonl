It can be liberating, freeing you from the shackles of \"stuff\" and allowing your spirit to soar.\n\nBut then there's the allure of accumulating possessions. Each object, each trinket, each dusty book with its dog-eared pages, whispers a story. They hold memories, echoes of adventures past, tangible reminders of the vibrant tapestry of life.\n\nMy own studio, for example, is a glorious mess! It's a symphony of colour and texture, overflowing with fabrics, paints, found objects, and half-finished masterpieces. It's chaotic, yes, but it's alive!
