If constantly helping others drains us to the point of burnout or exhaustion, we won't be able to help anyone, including ourselves, in the long run.\n* **Setting boundaries:**  It's healthy to have boundaries. We can't be expected to help everyone all the time, and it's okay to say no when we need to prioritize our own needs.\n\n**Arguments against letting personal cost be the only deciding factor:**\n\n* **Compassion and empathy:** Helping others is often the right thing to do, even if it comes with some personal sacrifice. Empathy and compassion are important human values that should guide our actions.\n* **Ripple effect:**  Helping someone in need can have a positive impact on their life and potentially inspire them to help others in the future. This creates a ripple effect of kindness.\n* **Community responsibility:** We are all part of a community, and we have a responsibility to support each other.
