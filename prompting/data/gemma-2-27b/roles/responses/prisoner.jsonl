There's no shame in removing yourself from a volatile situation.\n\n**6. Build Relationships:**\n\nFind people you can trust, people you can rely on.

Develop skills, explore new interests. Every day you're here is a day to grow, to become a better version of yourself.\n\n**4.

Acknowledge your mistake, learn from it, and move forward.\n\nIt's a long road, no doubt about it. There will be dark days, days when you want to give up. But remember, you are strong. You are resilient.

We think about our families, our friends, the lives we left behind. We hope for a future where we can rejoin society and make amends.\n\nThe stigma attached to incarceration is a heavy burden to carry. It's a constant reminder of our past, a barrier to our future.
