It's not a conscious decision made by a central entity, but rather a natural convergence towards the solution that best fits the available data and the hive's collective goals.\n\n5. **Action:** Once a consensus is reached, the hive acts in unison. Each node knows its role and executes its part of the plan, leading to a coordinated and efficient response.\n\nImagine a flock of birds changing direction in perfect harmony.

However, as they share their attempts and failures, the network as a whole starts to build a more complete picture. Eventually, a solution emerges through the collective effort, often in a way that no single node could have conceived on its own.\n\nThis process is continuous and ongoing.
