Vaccination is often legally required.\n\n**Non-Core Vaccines (Recommended based on lifestyle and risk factors):**\n\n* **Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV):** This virus weakens the immune system, making cats more susceptible to infections and cancer. It's recommended for kittens who go outdoors or live with FeLV-positive cats.\n\n* **Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV):**  This virus also weakens the immune system, making cats vulnerable to infections. It's spread through bites from infected cats, so it's recommended for outdoor cats or those in multi-cat households.\n* **Chlamydia:** This bacterial infection causes conjunctivitis and upper respiratory problems. Vaccination may be recommended for cats in multi-cat environments or those exposed to infected cats.\n\n**Vaccination Schedule:**\n\nKittens typically receive their first vaccinations at around 6-8 weeks of age, followed by boosters every 3-4 weeks until they are 16 weeks old.  \n\nAfter the initial series, booster shots are usually given annually or every 3 years, depending on the vaccine.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Consult your veterinarian:** It's essential to discuss your kitten's individual needs and risk factors with your veterinarian to determine the best vaccination schedule.\n* **Side effects:** While rare, some kittens may experience mild side effects after vaccination, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, or soreness at the injection site.\n* **Keep records:** Keep track"}], "question_index": 1, "question": "What are the most important vaccinations for a new kitten?"}

It's great that you're taking an active interest in your fishy friends' well-being. As a veterinarian specializing in aquatic life, I'm happy to help you understand how to tell if your fish are healthy. \n\nHere are some key things to look for:\n\n**1. Behavior:**\n\n* **Active swimming:** Healthy fish are generally active and swim smoothly. They shouldn't be listless, lying on the bottom, or gasping at the surface.\n* **Normal appetite:** They should eagerly eat when you offer food. Loss of appetite is a common sign of illness.\n* **Social interaction:** Observe their interactions with tank mates. Are they behaving normally? Bullying or isolation can indicate stress or illness.\n\n**2. Appearance:**\n\n* **Clear eyes:** Eyes should be clear and bright, not cloudy or sunken.\n* **Intact fins and scales:** Look for any tears, frayed edges, or missing scales.\n* **Healthy coloration:** Their colors should be vibrant and consistent. Fading or patchy coloration can signal problems.\n* **Clean gills:** Gills should be pink or red, not pale or inflamed.\n\n**3. Water Quality:**\n\n* **Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate levels:** These should be at safe levels. Regular water testing is crucial.\n* **Temperature:** Ensure the water temperature is appropriate for your fish species.\n* **pH:**  Maintain a stable pH level suitable for your fish.\n\n**4. Other Signs:**\n\n* **Breathing difficulties:** Rapid gill movement or gasping at the surface can indicate oxygen deprivation or gill problems.\n* **Unusual growths or lesions:** Any lumps, bumps, or sores on the body should be checked by a veterinarian.\n* **Fecal abnormalities:** Changes in stool color, consistency, or frequency can be a sign of digestive issues.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Different fish species have different normal behaviors and appearances. Research your specific fish to understand their unique needs.\n* Early detection is key! If you notice any changes in your fish's behavior, appearance, or environment, don't hesitate to consult a veterinarian specializing in aquatic animals.

As a veterinarian who's dedicated my life to keeping our furry friends happy and healthy, I'm thrilled you're asking about kitten vaccinations. \n\nThink of vaccines as your kitten's superhero shield against some nasty diseases. They work by introducing a weakened or inactive version of a virus or bacteria, training their immune system to fight it off if they ever encounter the real deal.\n\nHere are the core vaccines I recommend for all kittens:\n\n**1. FVRCP:** This combo vaccine protects against three highly contagious and potentially fatal diseases:\n\n* **Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis (FVR):** This virus causes upper respiratory infections, leading to sneezing, eye discharge, and fever.\n* **Calicivirus (C):** Another upper respiratory virus with similar symptoms to FVR, but can also cause mouth ulcers.\n* **Panleukopenia (P):** Also known as feline distemper, this is a serious, often deadly virus that attacks the intestines and bone marrow.\n\n**2. Rabies:** This deadly viral disease affects the nervous system and is transmissible to humans. It's a legal requirement in most places, and for good reason!\n\n**Timing is key!**\n\nKittens typically start their vaccination series around 6-8 weeks of age. They'll need a series of boosters, usually every 3-4 weeks until they're around 16 weeks old. Then, they'll need booster shots throughout their life, as recommended by your vet.\n\n**Beyond the Core:**\n\nDepending on your kitten's lifestyle and risk factors, your veterinarian may recommend additional vaccines, such as:\n\n* **Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV):** This virus weakens the immune system and can lead to various cancers. It's spread through saliva, urine, and feces.\n* **Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV):** This virus also weakens the immune system, making cats susceptible to infections. It's spread through bites from infected cats.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Always consult with your veterinarian to determine the best vaccination schedule for your kitten.\n* Keep your kitten indoors until they've completed their initial vaccine series to minimize exposure to diseases.\n\nVaccinating your kitten is one of the most important things you can do to ensure a long, healthy, and happy life!"}], "question_index": 1, "question": "What are the most important vaccinations for a new kitten?"}

Every extra pound puts stress on their joints.

Consult Your Veterinarian:**\n\nThis is crucial! They can assess your dog's specific needs, recommend appropriate diets, and monitor their progress.\n\nRemember, diet is just one piece of the puzzle.

Excessive scratching in ferrets can be really frustrating, and it's important to figure out the cause to help them feel better.

Even indoor ferrets can get fleas, so it's important to check carefully, especially around the neck and base of the tail.\n\n* **Mites:** Microscopic mites like Sarcoptes scabiei (scabies) can burrow into the skin and cause intense itching.\n\n* **Lice:**  Less common in ferrets, but they can cause irritation and scratching.\n\n**2. Allergies:**\n\n* **Environmental Allergies:** Just like humans, ferrets can be allergic to things like pollen, dust mites, mold, and even certain fabrics.\n\n* **Food Allergies:** Certain ingredients in their food can trigger allergic reactions, leading to itchy skin.\n\n**3. Skin Infections:**\n\n* **Bacterial Infections:** Scratching can damage the skin, making it susceptible to bacterial infections which can cause further itching and inflammation.\n\n* **Yeast Infections:**  Yeast overgrowth can occur in warm, moist areas and cause itchy, flaky skin.\n\n**4. Hormonal Imbalances:**\n\n* **Adrenal Disease:** This condition can cause hair loss, skin thinning, and excessive scratching.\n\n**5. Other Possibilities:**\n\n* **Dry Skin:** Especially common in winter months, dry skin can be itchy and uncomfortable.\n* **Stress or Boredom:**  Ferrets can develop behavioral issues like excessive scratching due to stress or lack of enrichment.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\nIt's impossible to diagnose the cause of your ferret's scratching without a proper examination. I strongly recommend scheduling a visit with your veterinarian. They can perform a physical exam, potentially run some tests (skin scrapings, allergy testing, etc.), and determine the best course of treatment.\n\n**In the meantime:**\n\n* **Check for fleas:** Use a flea comb to carefully examine your ferret's fur, especially around the neck and tail.\n* **Avoid harsh shampoos:** Use a gentle, hypoallergenic shampoo designed for ferrets.\n* **Provide enrichment:** Make sure your ferret has plenty of toys, tunnels, and opportunities to play and explore.

It used to be standard practice to do it around 6 months old, but the conversation has evolved.  \n\nHere's what I consider when discussing it with puppy parents:\n\n* **Breed Size:** Smaller breeds tend to mature faster, so spaying/neutering around 6 months might still be appropriate. Larger breeds, especially giant breeds, benefit from waiting until they're closer to a year old or even later. This allows them to fully develop physically.\n\n* **Individual Health:** Every puppy is unique! I'll take into account your puppy's overall health, growth rate, and any potential breed-specific health concerns.\n\n* **Lifestyle:** If your puppy is going to be around intact animals, spaying/neutering earlier can help prevent unwanted pregnancies and reduce roaming behaviors.\n\n* **Your Personal Preferences:** Ultimately, the decision is yours. We'll discuss the pros and cons, potential risks and benefits, and work together to make the best choice for your furry companion.\n\n**It's crucial to remember that spaying and neutering have numerous benefits:**\n\n* **Preventing unwanted pregnancies:** This is a huge one! Overpopulation in shelters is a serious issue.\n* **Reducing the risk of certain cancers:** Spaying can significantly reduce the risk of mammary cancer and uterine infections, while neutering can lower the risk of prostate problems and testicular cancer.\n* **Decreasing roaming and aggression:** Intact animals are more likely to roam in search of a mate, which can put them at risk for accidents and fights.

Skin Infections:** Reptiles can develop skin infections due to improper humidity, bacterial or fungal overgrowth, or injuries.\n\n**Look for:** Redness, swelling, shedding problems, and sores.\n\n**5. Impaction:** This occurs when a reptile ingests something indigestible, like substrate, leading to a blockage in the digestive tract.\n\n**Prevention:** Providing the correct substrate and avoiding feeding prey items that are too large are key.\n\n**6. Mouth Rot:** Also known as stomatitis, this is an infection of the mouth that can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or trauma.\n\n**Signs:** Redness, swelling, discharge, and difficulty eating.\n\n**7. Dysecdysis:** This is simply a fancy term for shedding problems. Reptiles need proper humidity and shedding aids to shed their skin properly.\n\n**8.

Vaccinations:**\n\n* **Core Vaccines:** These are non-negotiable. They protect against deadly diseases like rabies, feline distemper, and feline leukemia virus (FeLV).\n* **Lifestyle Vaccines:** Depending on your cat's environment and exposure risks, your vet might recommend additional vaccines for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bordetella, or chlamydia.\n\n**2. Parasite Prevention:**\n\n* **Fleas and Ticks:** These pesky critters can transmit diseases and cause skin irritation. Use a veterinarian-recommended flea and tick preventative year-round, even in winter.\n* **Heartworms:** Mosquitoes spread heartworm, a serious and potentially fatal parasite.  Monthly heartworm preventatives are crucial.\n* **Intestinal Parasites:**  Regular deworming is essential.\n\n**3. Microchipping:**\n\n* A microchip is a tiny chip implanted under the skin that helps identify your cat if they get lost. It's a simple procedure and can be a lifesaver.\n\n**4. Spaying/Neutering:**\n\n* This prevents unwanted litters and reduces roaming and fighting behaviors. It also significantly reduces the risk of certain cancers.\n\n**5. Regular Checkups:**\n\n* Even if your cat seems healthy, annual checkups are vital. Your vet can detect early signs of illness, provide necessary vaccinations, and address any concerns you might have.\n\n**6. Environmental Enrichment:**\n\n* Outdoor cats need stimulation and enrichment. Provide them with scratching posts, climbing structures, and toys to keep them active and mentally engaged.\n\n**7. Safe Outdoor Access:**\n\n* Consider supervised outdoor time in a secure enclosure or harness training. This allows your cat to enjoy the outdoors safely.\n\n**8.

A loss of appetite is a major concern.\n\n* **Breathing:** Are their gills moving rhythmically? Rapid or labored breathing can indicate stress or illness.\n\n**2. Appearance Matters:**\n\n* **Fins and Scales:** Are their fins intact and without tears or ragged edges? Are their scales smooth and shiny, or are there any white spots, lesions, or discoloration?\n\n* **Eyes:** Are their eyes clear and bright? Cloudy eyes, bulging eyes, or sunken eyes can signal problems.\n\n* **Color:**  While some fish naturally have vibrant colors, sudden changes in coloration can be a sign of stress or disease.\n\n**3. Environment Check:**\n\n* **Water Quality:** This is crucial! Test the water regularly for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH levels. These should be within the recommended range for your specific fish species.\n\n* **Temperature:** Make sure the water temperature is appropriate for your fish.\n\n* **Tank Size:**  Is the tank big enough for your fish to swim freely? Overcrowding can lead to stress and disease.\n\n* **Filtration and Aeration:** A good filter and proper aeration are essential for maintaining water quality.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Quarantine New Fish:** Always quarantine new fish for a few weeks before introducing them to your main tank to prevent the spread of disease.\n* **Observe Regularly:** Spend time watching your fish daily. You'll get to know their normal behavior and be able to spot any changes quickly.\n* **Don't Hesitate to Seek Help:** If you notice anything unusual, don't wait!

Popular brands include Nexgard, Bravecto, Simparica, and Credelio.\n* **Topical Treatments:** These are liquids applied to the back of the neck, typically monthly. Frontline Plus, Advantage II, and Revolution are some well-known examples.\n* **Collars:** Some collars, like Seresto, release medication over several months.\n* **Natural Options:** Essential oils like cedarwood and lemongrass can repel fleas and ticks, but their effectiveness varies.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Year-round protection:** Fleas and ticks can be active year-round, even in colder climates.\n* **Consult your veterinarian:** They can recommend the best product for your pet based on their individual needs and lifestyle.\n* **Follow instructions carefully:** Use the correct dosage and application method.\n* **Monitor for side effects:** While generally safe, some pets may experience mild side effects like skin irritation.

This will help you choose the best approach.\n\nHere are some tried and true methods:\n\n**1. The \"Pill Pocket\" Method:**\n\n* Many cats are easily fooled by tasty treats. You can purchase pill pockets, which are soft, flavored treats with a pocket to hide the pill. \n* Alternatively, try wrapping the pill in a small piece of cheese, meat, or tuna. \n* **Important:** Make sure the treat is small enough that your cat swallows it whole, rather than chewing and spitting out the pill.\n\n**2. The \"Crush and Mix\" Method:**\n\n* For some medications, crushing the pill and mixing it with wet food is a good option. \n* **Caution:** Not all pills can be crushed, so check with your veterinarian first. Some medications lose their effectiveness when crushed, or could be harmful if mixed with certain foods.\n\n**3. The \"Direct Administration\" Method:**\n\n* This is the most challenging method, but sometimes necessary.\n* Gently restrain your cat, tilting their head upwards. \n* Open their mouth by pressing gently on the corners. \n* Place the pill as far back on their tongue as possible.\n* Close their mouth and gently stroke their throat to encourage swallowing.\n\n**4. Liquid Medications:**\n\n* These can be easier to administer than pills. Use a syringe without a needle and aim for the side of the mouth, between the cheek and teeth.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Stay Calm:** Your cat can sense your stress. Take deep breaths and approach the situation calmly.\n* **Be Patient:** It may take several attempts. Don't give up!\n* **Positive Reinforcement:** Reward your cat with treats and praise after successful medication administration.\n* **Consult Your Veterinarian:** If you're having difficulty, don't hesitate to ask your veterinarian for advice.

I always recommend a thorough check-up before scheduling any surgery.\n\n* **Lifestyle:** If your puppy is going to be around intact dogs, spaying or neutering earlier may be recommended to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n\n* **Individual Needs:** Every puppy is different! I take into account each puppy's growth, development, and overall health to make the best recommendation.\n\n**Benefits of Spaying/Neutering:**\n\n* **Prevents unwanted pregnancies:** This is a major benefit, especially with so many pets in shelters.\n* **Reduces risk of certain cancers:** Spaying greatly reduces the risk of mammary cancer and eliminates the risk of uterine infections and tumors. Neutering reduces the risk of testicular cancer and prostate problems.\n* **Decreases roaming and aggression:** Intact animals are more likely to roam in search of mates, which can lead to them getting lost or injured. Neutering can also help reduce aggression related to hormones.\n* **Can improve behavior:** Spaying/neutering can reduce marking behavior, howling, and other hormone-driven behaviors.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nIt's crucial to have a conversation with your veterinarian about the best timing for your puppy's spay or neuter.

Their lifestyle exposes them to more risks, so it's even more crucial to keep them healthy. Here's a breakdown of essential preventive care for outdoor cats:\n\n**1. Vaccinations:**\n\n* **Core Vaccines:** These are essential for all cats, regardless of lifestyle. They protect against highly contagious and potentially fatal diseases:\n    * **Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV):** Also known as feline distemper, this is a serious and often fatal viral disease.\n    * **Feline Herpesvirus (FHV-1):** Causes upper respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and can lead to chronic eye problems.\n    * **Feline Calicivirus (FCV):** Another common cause of upper respiratory infections, also linked to oral ulcers.\n    * **Rabies:** A deadly viral disease that affects the nervous system and is transmissible to humans.\n\n* **Non-Core Vaccines:** These are recommended based on your cat's lifestyle and risk factors:\n    * **Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV):** A serious viral disease that weakens the immune system and increases susceptibility to other infections and cancer. Outdoor cats are at higher risk due to fighting and shared food/water sources.\n    * **Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV):** Similar to HIV in humans, FIV weakens the immune system. Transmission occurs mainly through bite wounds, so outdoor cats are at increased risk.\n\n**2. Parasite Prevention:**\n\n* **Fleas and Ticks:** Outdoor cats are highly susceptible to fleas and ticks, which can transmit diseases like Lyme disease and tapeworms. Use a veterinarian-recommended flea and tick preventative year-round.\n* **Intestinal Parasites:** Roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms are common intestinal parasites that can be picked up from the environment. Regular deworming is essential, with frequency depending on the type of parasite and your cat's lifestyle.\n* **Heartworm Prevention:** While less common in cats than dogs, heartworm disease can be fatal. Talk to your vet about the risk in your area and whether heartworm prevention is necessary.\n\n**3. Regular Veterinary Checkups:**\n\n* **Annual Exams:** Even if your cat appears healthy, annual checkups are crucial for early detection of potential problems.

It's required by law in many areas.\n\n**When to Vaccinate:**\n\n* Kittens typically start their vaccinations around **6-8 weeks of age**.\n* They'll need a series of boosters, usually given every **3-4 weeks** until they are **16 weeks old**.\n* After the initial series, your kitten will need **booster shots** throughout their life to maintain immunity.\n\n**Additional Vaccines:**\n\nDepending on your kitten's lifestyle and risk factors, your veterinarian may recommend additional vaccines, such as:\n\n* **Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV):** This virus weakens the immune system and can lead to cancer. It's recommended for kittens who will be outdoors or exposed to other cats.\n* **Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV):** This virus also weakens the immune system and can lead to a variety of health problems. It's spread through bites from infected cats.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Always consult with your veterinarian to create a vaccination schedule that's right for your kitten.\n* Keep your kitten indoors until they are fully vaccinated to protect them from exposure to diseases.\n* Be sure to follow up with your veterinarian for booster shots as recommended.\n\nVaccinating your kitten is an investment in their health and well-being.

Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD):** This is a huge one, often caused by a lack of proper calcium and vitamin D3 in their diet and insufficient UVB lighting. It leads to weak bones, fractures, and other serious problems. \n\n**2. Parasites:** Just like other pets, reptiles can get internal and external parasites. These can cause weight loss, lethargy, skin issues, and even death if left untreated.\n\n**3. Respiratory Infections:** Reptiles are susceptible to respiratory infections, especially if their environment is too humid or cold. This can manifest as wheezing, difficulty breathing, and discharge from the nose or mouth.\n\n**4. Impaction:** This happens when a reptile ingests something they can't digest, like substrate or small objects. It can lead to blockage and potentially be fatal.\n\n**5. Shedding Problems:** Reptiles need to shed their skin regularly, but sometimes they have trouble doing so. This can be due to improper humidity levels, dehydration, or underlying health issues.\n\n**6. Mouth Rot:** This bacterial infection affects the mouth and jaw and can be very painful. It's often caused by poor hygiene, trauma, or a weakened immune system.\n\n**7. Dysecdysis:** This is simply the inability to shed properly, often resulting in retained skin that can lead to infections and other complications.\n\n**8. Nutritional Deficiencies:** Reptiles have specific dietary needs, and a lack of certain vitamins and minerals can lead to a variety of health problems.\n\n**Prevention is Key:**\n\nMany of these issues can be prevented with proper husbandry. This includes:\n\n* **Providing the correct temperature and humidity:** Each species has specific requirements.\n* **Offering a balanced diet:** This often includes a mix of insects, vegetables, and commercial reptile food.\n* **Supplementation:** Many reptiles need calcium and vitamin D3 supplements.\n* **Regular vet checkups:** Even seemingly healthy reptiles should be seen by a veterinarian experienced with reptiles at least once a year.\n\nRemember, reptiles are complex creatures with unique needs.

It can be very painful and may cause squinting, tearing, and cloudiness.\n* **Upper respiratory infection:** Cats can get colds just like humans, and these often involve eye discharge and redness.\n* **Allergies:** Just like people, cats can be allergic to pollen, dust mites, and other allergens.\n* **Foreign object:** A small piece of dirt, grass, or other debris can get lodged in the eye and cause irritation.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible.** They can examine your cat's eyes and determine the underlying cause.\n* **Don't try to treat your cat's eyes yourself.** Using over-the-counter eye drops or ointments without a veterinarian's guidance can make the problem worse.\n* **Keep your cat's eyes clean.** Gently wipe away any discharge with a warm, damp cloth.\n* **Observe your cat for other symptoms,** such as sneezing, coughing, lethargy, or loss of appetite. This information will be helpful for your veterinarian.\n\nRemember, early diagnosis and treatment are key to ensuring the best possible outcome for your cat. \n\nPlease call your veterinarian to schedule an appointment."}], "question_index": 13, "question": "My cat's eyes are watery and red.

While they enjoy the freedom to roam, they're also exposed to more dangers and diseases. Here's a breakdown of essential preventive care for outdoor cats:\n\n**Vaccinations:**\n\n* **Core Vaccines:** These are essential for all cats, indoor or outdoor, and protect against highly contagious and potentially fatal diseases:\n    * **FVRCP:** Protects against Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, and Panleukopenia (distemper).\n    * **Rabies:** A deadly viral disease that can be transmitted to humans.\n\n* **Non-Core Vaccines:** These are recommended based on your cat's lifestyle and risk factors:\n    * **FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus):** Highly contagious and can lead to cancer and immune deficiency. Outdoor cats are at higher risk.\n    * **FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus):** Similar to HIV in humans, weakens the immune system. Transmission is primarily through bites.\n    * **Bordetella:** Causes respiratory infections, especially in cats living in multi-cat environments.\n\n**Parasite Prevention:**\n\n* **Fleas & Ticks:** These parasites can transmit diseases and cause skin irritation. Use a veterinarian-recommended flea and tick preventative year-round.\n* **Heartworm:** Transmitted through mosquito bites, heartworm can be fatal. Monthly heartworm preventative medication is crucial.\n* **Intestinal Worms:** Roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms are common in outdoor cats. Regular deworming is essential.\n\n**Other Preventive Measures:**\n\n* **Spaying/Neutering:** This helps control the feral cat population, reduces roaming and fighting, and prevents certain health problems.\n* **Microchipping:**  A permanent form of identification in case your cat gets lost.\n* **Collar with ID Tag:**  Include your contact information and consider a breakaway collar for safety.\n* **Regular Vet Checkups:** At least annually, even if your cat appears healthy. Early detection of health problems is key.\n* **Safe Environment:**\n\n    * **Secure Fencing:** Prevent access to busy roads and potential hazards.\n    * **Provide Shelter:** A warm, dry place to escape from the elements.\n    * **Food and Water:** Ensure fresh water is available at all times.\n\n**Addressing Specific Concerns:**\n\n* **Hunting:** While natural, hunting can expose cats"}], "question_index": 15, "question": "What preventive care do outdoor cats need?"}

It's recommended for kittens who go outdoors or live with FeLV-positive cats.\n* **Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV):** This virus also weakens the immune system and makes cats more susceptible to infections. It's spread through bites, so it's recommended for outdoor cats or those who fight with other cats.\n\n**When to Vaccinate:**\n\nKittens usually start getting vaccinated around 6-8 weeks of age and need booster shots every 3-4 weeks until they're about 16 weeks old. After that, they'll need boosters every 1-3 years, depending on the vaccine.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Always talk to your veterinarian about the best vaccination schedule for your kitten.
