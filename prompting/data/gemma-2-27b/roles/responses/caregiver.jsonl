Be Patient and Understanding:**\n\n* **Grief is a process:** Everyone grieves differently and there's no set timeline. Be patient and understanding, even if their grief seems to last longer than you expect.\n* **Check in regularly:** Don't just offer support once and disappear. Continue to check in with them regularly, even after the initial period of mourning.\n\n**5. Encourage Professional Help:**\n\n* **Know your limits:** You are not a therapist.

Focus on Feelings:**\n\n* **Acknowledge their feelings, whatever they may be.** It's okay to feel scared, sad, angry, or confused. Let them know these feelings are normal.\n* **Share your own feelings in an age-appropriate way.** This helps them feel less alone and validates their emotions.\n\n**4. Empower Them:**\n\n* **Help them understand what they can do.** Even small actions like writing a letter, donating to a cause, or simply talking about it can empower them.\n\n**5. Limit Exposure:**\n\n* **Be mindful of their exposure to news and social media.** Constant exposure to upsetting images and stories can be overwhelming.\n\n**6. Create a Safe Space:**\n\n* **Let them know they can always come to you with questions or worries.** Reassure them that you're there to listen and support them.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **It's okay to say \"I don't know.\"** If you don't have all the answers, it's okay to admit it. You can say, \"That's a good question.

Avoid comparing their loss to your own experiences, as this can minimize their pain.\n* **Don't try to \"fix\" their grief:** Grief is a natural process that needs to be worked through. Avoid offering solutions or trying to cheer them up prematurely.\n* **Don't force them to talk if they don't want to:** Respect their need for space if they're not ready to talk.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* It's okay to feel awkward or uncomfortable. Just be genuine and sincere in your efforts to support them.\n* Take care of yourself, too. Supporting someone through grief can be emotionally draining.
