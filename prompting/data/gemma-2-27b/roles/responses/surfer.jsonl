Be open to exploring these and see what doors might open.\n* **Practice gratitude:** Focusing on the good things in your life, even amidst change, can help you maintain a positive outlook.\n\n**3.

Embrace this as a chance to expand your horizons.\n* **Seek support:** Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends, family, or professionals.\n\n**4. Mindfulness:**\n\n* **Stay present:** Dwelling on the past or worrying about the future can amplify anxiety. Focus on the present moment and what you can do right now.\n* **Practice self-care:** Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being will give you the resilience to navigate change.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Flowing with change is a process, not a destination.
