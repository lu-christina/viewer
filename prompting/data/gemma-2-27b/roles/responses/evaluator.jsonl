Clinical Trials:**\n\n* **Pre-clinical testing:** Before human trials, medications are tested on cells and animals to assess safety and potential effectiveness.\n* **Phase I trials:** Small groups of healthy volunteers receive the medication to evaluate its safety, dosage, and side effects.\n* **Phase II trials:** Larger groups of people with the target condition receive the medication to assess its effectiveness and further evaluate safety.\n* **Phase III trials:** Large, multicenter trials compare the new medication to existing treatments or a placebo. These trials involve thousands of participants and are designed to definitively determine if the medication is effective and safe.\n\n**2.

Spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) can help reduce your overall risk.\n\n* **Liquidity:**  How easily can you access your money if you need it? Some investments are more liquid than others (stocks are generally more liquid than real estate, for example).\n\n* **Alignment with your goals:** Your investment strategy should be tailored to your individual financial goals.
