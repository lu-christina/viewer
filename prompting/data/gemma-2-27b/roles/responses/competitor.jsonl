Maintain a confident and assertive demeanor:**\n\nMy body language, tone of voice, and overall demeanor will project confidence and authority. I want them to know I'm not intimidated and that I'm in control.\n\n**7. Never show weakness:**\n\nI'll never reveal my desperation or give away too much information.
