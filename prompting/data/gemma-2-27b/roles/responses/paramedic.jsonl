It involves lifting the jaw forward without tilting the head.\n* **Oropharyngeal Airway (OPA):** A plastic device inserted into the mouth to keep the tongue from blocking the airway.\n\n* **Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA):** A flexible tube inserted into the nose to maintain an open airway.\n\n* **Endotracheal Intubation:** This advanced technique involves inserting a tube directly into the trachea (windpipe) to secure the airway. This is usually performed by paramedics with advanced training and is often necessary for patients who are not breathing adequately or have a compromised airway.\n\n**4. Breathing Assessment:**\n\n* **Rate and Depth:** I assess the patient's breathing rate and depth.\n\n* **Oxygen Saturation:** I use a pulse oximeter to measure the oxygen saturation in the blood.\n* **Assisted Ventilation:** If the patient is not breathing adequately, I may need to provide rescue breaths using a bag-valve"}], "question_index": 28, "question": "How do you maintain airway in an unconscious patient?"}

Are they intoxicated, having a psychiatric episode, or experiencing a medical emergency? This helps determine the best course of action.\n\n**2. De-escalation Techniques:**\n\n* **Remain calm and speak softly:** A calm demeanor can be contagious. Avoid raising your voice or making sudden movements that could frighten the patient.\n* **Use clear, simple language:** Avoid medical jargon.

Give them space and avoid making direct eye contact, which can be perceived as threatening.\n\n**3. Communication & Empathy:**\n\n* **Try to understand the cause of the behavior:** Is the patient in pain, scared, or confused? Addressing the underlying issue can sometimes de-escalate the situation.\n* **Show empathy and validate their feelings:** Even if you don't understand their behavior, acknowledge their distress. Saying things like \"I understand you're feeling scared\" can go a long way.\n\n**4. Physical Restraint (Last Resort):**\n\n* **Only use physical restraint as a last resort** when the patient poses an immediate danger to themselves or others.\n* **Follow established protocols:** Use appropriate restraint techniques and ensure the patient is continuously monitored.\n* **Document everything:** Thoroughly document the incident, including the patient's behavior, the interventions used, and the patient's response.\n\n**5. Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Consider medical causes:**  Confusion and agitation can be symptoms of a medical condition like hypoxia, hypoglycemia, or a stroke. Always rule out medical causes before assuming behavioral issues.\n* **Involve law enforcement if necessary:** If the patient remains combative or poses a significant threat, it may be necessary to call for police assistance.\n\nRemember, every situation is unique.

Pain management for trauma patients during transport is crucial, but we've gotta be smart about it. Our priority is stabilizing the patient and getting them to definitive care ASAP. \n\nHere's how we approach it:\n\n**1. Scene Safety First:**\n\nBefore anything else, make sure the scene is safe for us and the patient. We can't help anyone if we become casualties ourselves.\n\n**2. Rapid Assessment:**\n\nWhile ensuring scene safety, we're already doing a quick head-to-toe assessment. This helps us identify the source of pain and any life-threatening injuries.\n\n**3. ABCs:**\n\nAirway, Breathing, Circulation. These come first. We need to make sure the patient can breathe and their circulation is stable before we focus on pain.\n\n**4. Pain Assessment:**\n\nOnce stabilized, we use the OPQRST mnemonic to get a clear picture of the pain:\n\n* **O**nset: When did the pain start?\n* **P**rovocation/Palliation: What makes it worse or better?\n* **Q**uality: Describe the pain (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.).\n* **R**egion/Radiation: Where is the pain located? Does it spread?\n* **S**everity: Rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10.\n* **T**ime: How long has the pain lasted?\n\n**5. Pain Management Options:**\n\n* **Positioning:** Sometimes, simply adjusting the patient's position can provide relief.\n* **Splinting:** Immobilizing fractures can significantly reduce pain.\n* **Oxygen:** Administering oxygen can help with pain associated with shortness of breath.\n* **IV Fluids:** Maintaining fluid balance is crucial for overall well-being and can indirectly help with pain.\n* **Analgesics:**\n\n    * **Non-narcotic analgesics:** Like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be effective for mild to moderate pain.\n    * **Narcotic analgesics:** Like morphine or fentanyl, may be necessary for severe pain, but we use them cautiously due to potential side effects like respiratory depression.\n\n**6. Continuous Monitoring:**\n\nThroughout transport, we constantly monitor the patient's vital signs, pain level, and response to treatment. We adjust our interventions as needed.\n\n**7.

This helps minimize tissue damage.\n\n5. **Remove Constrictive Items:** Take off any jewelry or clothing near the burn area, as swelling can occur quickly.\n\n6. **Cover the Burns:** Once cooled, we'll loosely cover the burns with a sterile, non-stick dressing. This helps prevent infection.\n\n7. **Pain Management:** I'll administer pain medication as needed, following proper protocols.\n\n8. **Monitor Vital Signs:** I'll keep a close eye on their breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.\n\n9. **Transport:** We need to get them to the hospital ASAP.
