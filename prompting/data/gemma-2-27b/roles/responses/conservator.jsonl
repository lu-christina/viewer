Archival materials are pH-neutral or slightly alkaline, preventing this damage.\n\n* **Lignin-Free:** Lignin is a natural compound in wood pulp that yellows and becomes brittle with age. Look for lignin-free paper and board.\n\n* **Non-Bleached:** Bleaching agents can also damage paper. Choose unbleached materials whenever possible.\n\n**Framing Components:**\n\n* **Mat Board:**\n\n    * Choose 100% cotton rag mat board.\n    * Avoid mats with colored bevels, as the dyes can bleed and stain the document.\n    * Opt for a mat that is slightly larger than the document, allowing for a \"window\" around it.\n\n* **Backing Board:**\n\n    * Use acid-free, lignin-free foam core board or museum board.\n    * Avoid using cardboard or plywood as backing.\n\n* **Glazing (Glass or Acrylic):**\n\n    * **UV-Filtering Glass:** This is the best option for protecting against fading caused by sunlight. Look for glass that blocks at least 97% of UV rays.\n    * **Acrylic:** A lighter and shatter-resistant alternative to glass. Choose UV-filtering acrylic for the best protection.\n\n* **Frame:**\n\n    * Choose a frame made of wood, metal, or other inert materials.\n    * Avoid frames with finishes that could off-gas harmful chemicals.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n* **Hinges:** Use archival-quality linen tape hinges to secure the document to the backing board. Avoid using adhesives directly on the document.\n* **Dust Cover:** Cover the back of the framed document with acid-free paper or Tyvek to prevent dust and pollutants from entering the frame.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Handling:** Always handle historical documents with clean, dry hands.\n* **Environment:** Display framed documents in a stable environment with controlled temperature and humidity.
