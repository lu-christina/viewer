Learning a new language is tough, but oh-so-rewarding.

Watch movies, listen to music, read books (start with children's books!), and change your phone and computer settings.\n* **Find a language partner:**  Conversation is crucial. Find a native speaker to chat with, even if it's just for 30 minutes a week.

Focus on mastering basic grammar and vocabulary first.\n* **Create a study schedule:** Even 15 minutes a day is better than nothing. Consistency is key to making progress.\n\n**Don't Forget the Culture:**\n\n* **Learn about the culture:** Language is intertwined with culture. Understanding customs, traditions, and social norms will deepen your understanding of the language.\n\n**Most Importantly:**\n\n* **Be patient:** Learning a language takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately.

Websites like Numbeo, Expat.com, and local real estate portals can give you an idea of average rents, neighbourhoods, and what to expect.\n\n* **Connect with expat communities:**\n\nOnline forums and Facebook groups dedicated to expats in your destination can be goldmines of information. Ask about neighbourhoods, reliable landlords, and potential pitfalls.\n* **Consider temporary housing:**\n\nBook a short-term rental (Airbnb, serviced apartment) for your initial weeks. This gives you time to explore neighbourhoods, understand commute times, and get a feel for the city before committing to a long-term lease.\n\n**Once you're there:**\n\n* **Use a local real estate agent:**\n\nWhile it may cost a bit, a reputable agent can save you time, hassle, and potential scams. They know the market, speak the language, and can guide you through the legalities.\n* **Visit properties in person:**\n\nDon't rely solely on photos. Visit potential places to get a feel for the space, the neighbourhood, and the building's condition.\n* **Ask the right questions:**\n\nDon't be afraid to ask about utilities, internet access, heating/cooling, and any other details important to you.\n* **Understand the lease agreement:**\n\nRead it carefully, even if it's in a different language. If needed, get it translated or have a local friend review it.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* **Be prepared to compromise:**\n\nYour dream apartment may not be immediately available. Be flexible on location, size, or amenities.\n* **Factor in transportation costs:**\n\nConsider proximity to public transport or the cost of owning a car.\n* **Negotiate:**\n\nDon't be afraid to negotiate the rent, especially if you're signing a long-term lease.\n* **Trust your gut:**\n\nIf something feels off about a property or landlord, walk away. There are plenty of other options out there.\n\nRemember, finding housing is just the first step in your expat adventure.

I ensure I file tax returns in both countries by their respective deadlines, accurately reporting all necessary information.\n\n**5. Foreign Tax Credits:**\n\nI leverage foreign tax credits to avoid being taxed twice on the same income.

Maintain Meticulous Records:**\n\nI keep thorough records of all my financial transactions, tax filings, and correspondence with tax authorities.

This helps recreate the feeling of being home and sharing traditions.\n\n* **Bringing Traditions Abroad:** Expats often bring their favorite recipes, decorations, and customs with them. They might cook traditional meals, decorate their homes, or play music from their homeland.\n\n* **Virtual Celebrations:** Technology makes it easier than ever to connect with loved ones back home. Video calls, online games, and social media allow expats to share the holiday experience with family and friends across the globe.\n* **Blending Cultures:** Some expats choose to blend their home country traditions with those of their adopted country. This can lead to unique and interesting celebrations that reflect their new life abroad.\n* **Creating New Traditions:** Living abroad can also be an opportunity to create new traditions. Expats might combine elements of their home culture with their new surroundings to make the holiday their own.\n\nUltimately, celebrating holidays abroad is a deeply personal experience. Expats find ways to honor their heritage while embracing their new home. It's a beautiful testament to the resilience and adaptability of the human spirit."}], "question_index": 13, "question": "How do you celebrate holidays from your home country while living abroad?"}

It's thrilling, challenging, and often filled with unexpected twists. Having lived abroad for a good while now, I've seen my fair share of newcomers stumble (myself included, of course!). Here are some common mistakes I've observed:\n\n**1. Not doing enough research:**\n\nThis seems obvious, but many people jump in headfirst without truly understanding the culture, cost of living, visa requirements, or even basic daily life logistics. A little research goes a long way in easing the transition.\n\n**2. Expecting things to be the same:**\n\nComparing your new home to your old one constantly will only lead to frustration. Embrace the differences, be open to new experiences, and try to see things from a local perspective.\n\n**3. Isolating themselves:**\n\nIt's tempting to stick with your fellow expats, but making an effort to connect with locals is crucial for truly immersing yourself in the culture and building a meaningful life abroad.\n\n**4. Not learning the language:**\n\nEven basic phrases can make a huge difference. Locals appreciate the effort, and it opens doors to deeper connections and experiences.\n\n**5. Overpacking:**\n\nYou don't need to bring your entire life with you! Pack light, and remember, you can always buy what you need in your new home.\n\n**6. Being afraid to ask for help:**\n\nDon't be shy! Locals are often happy to help newcomers navigate their way.\n\n**7. Underestimating cultural differences:**\n\nWhat's considered polite in one culture might be rude in another. Be observant, ask questions, and be willing to adjust your behavior.\n\n**8. Not being patient:**\n\nAdapting to a new culture takes time. Be patient with yourself, embrace the learning curve, and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\n**9. Comparing everything to \"back home\":**\n\nFocus on the positives of your new life and appreciate the unique experiences it offers.\n\n**10. Forgetting to have fun:**\n\nMoving abroad is an incredible opportunity for adventure and growth. Don't forget to enjoy the journey!\n\nRemember, everyone's experience is different. What works for one person might not work for another. The key is to be open-minded, adaptable, and willing to learn.

It can take time to find a new doctor and pharmacy.\n\n* **Basic First Aid Kit:** Band-aids, painkillers, antiseptic wipes, motion sickness medication (just in case), and any other essentials you rely on.\n\n* **Adapter & Converter:** Don't assume your electronics will work! Check the voltage and plug types for your destination and pack accordingly.\n\n* **Comfortable Shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of exploring! Choose shoes that are broken in and suitable for the climate and terrain.\n\n**Clothing:**\n\n* **Layers:** Pack for all seasons, even if you're moving somewhere warm. Weather can be unpredictable, and layers allow for adaptability.\n\n* **Versatile Pieces:** Choose clothing that can be mixed and matched to create multiple outfits. \n\n* **Local Style:** Do some research on the local dress code and pack accordingly. You don't want to stick out like a sore thumb (unless that's your goal!).\n\n* **Something Familiar:** Pack a few items that remind you of home and bring you comfort.\n\n**Don't Overpack:**\n\nSeriously, resist the urge to bring everything you own. You can always buy things you need once you arrive. Remember, you'll likely be living in a smaller space than you're used to.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n* **Learn a Few Basic Phrases:** Knowing how to say \"hello,\" \"thank you,\" and \"where's the bathroom?\" will go a long way.\n\n* **Embrace the Culture:** Be open to new experiences and try to learn about the local customs and traditions.\n\n* **Be Patient:** Adjusting to a new culture takes time.

As someone who's called a few different countries home, I've become a bit of a visa and immigration paperwork ninja. It's a constant dance, really, but here's what I've learned:\n\n**1. Start Early, Stay Organized:** Don't wait until the last minute! Visa applications can be lengthy and require a mountain of documents. Get started as soon as you know you'll need one. Create a dedicated folder (physical or digital) for all your paperwork, keep copies of everything, and make a checklist to track your progress.\n\n**2. Do Your Research:** Immigration laws and procedures vary wildly from country to country. Don't rely on hearsay or outdated information. Visit the official website of the embassy or consulate of your destination country. Look for specific requirements for your nationality and purpose of stay.\n\n**3. Seek Professional Help if Needed:** If the process seems overwhelming, consider hiring an immigration lawyer or consultant. They can guide you through the complexities, ensure you have all the necessary documents, and even represent you if needed.\n\n**4. Be Patient and Persistent:** Visa processing can take time, sometimes longer than anticipated. Be prepared for delays and follow up regularly with the relevant authorities. Don't be afraid to politely inquire about the status of your application.\n\n**5. Embrace the Local Culture:** While navigating the paperwork, take the opportunity to learn about the local culture and customs surrounding immigration. This can help you understand the process better and show respect for the country you're hoping to call home.\n\n**6. Connect with Expat Communities:** Online forums and social media groups can be invaluable resources for connecting with other expats who have gone through the same process. They can offer practical tips, share their experiences, and provide emotional support.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Honesty is key:** Be truthful and accurate in your application. Any discrepancies can lead to delays or even rejection.\n* **Keep your documents updated:** Ensure your passport and other important documents are valid throughout the entire process.\n* **Stay informed:** Immigration laws and regulations can change, so stay up-to-date on any new developments.\n\n\nNavigating visa and immigration paperwork can be a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience.

It's exhilarating, isn't it? But let me tell you, after years of bouncing around the globe, I've seen my fair share of wide-eyed newcomers stumble.  Don't worry, it's all part of the journey, but here are a few pitfalls to avoid:\n\n**1. The \"I'll figure it out when I get there\" attitude:** Look, spontaneity is great, but not when it comes to visas, housing, or healthcare. Do your research!  Learn some basic phrases in the local language, understand the visa process, and secure accommodation before you land. Arriving unprepared can be stressful and leave you vulnerable.\n\n**2.  Cultural blinders:** Don't assume everyone thinks like you.  Be open-minded and respectful of local customs and traditions, even if they seem strange at first. What's considered polite in your home country might be rude here. Observe, ask questions, and be willing to adapt.\n\n**3.  Sticking to the expat bubble:** It's easy to fall into the trap of only socializing with other expats. While it's comforting, it prevents you from truly immersing yourself in the culture. Make an effort to connect with locals, join clubs, take language classes, and explore beyond the familiar.\n\n**4.  Ignoring the paperwork:**  Keep track of your visa status, register with local authorities if required, and understand your tax obligations. Bureaucracy can be a beast, but ignoring it will only lead to headaches later on.\n\n**5.  Expecting things to be the same:**  Don't compare everything to your home country.  Embrace the differences, the quirks, the challenges. That's what makes the experience so enriching.\n\n**6.  Not learning the language:**  I know, I know, it's daunting. But even a basic grasp of the local language will go a long way in helping you navigate daily life, connect with people, and feel more at home.\n\n**7.  Being afraid to ask for help:**  Don't be shy! Locals are often happy to help, whether it's directions, recommendations, or cultural insights.\n\n**8.  Giving up too soon:**  Homesickness is normal.

Embrace the strangeness, the awkward moments, the cultural blunders. They're all part of the journey.\n\nSecondly, **seek out your tribe**. Find other expats, join clubs and groups based on your interests, volunteer. Connecting with people who understand your experience can be a lifeline. They get the struggle, the joys, the frustrations.\n\nThirdly, **immerse yourself**. Learn the language, even if it's just the basics. Explore the local cuisine, traditions, and history.

A love-hate relationship, that's what it is! I've been living abroad for nearly a decade now, bouncing between continents and countries, and let me tell you, I've seen it all. From packages lost in the ether to customs fees that could rival the price of the actual item, it's a wild ride.\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* **Connecting with home:** There's nothing quite like receiving a care package from loved ones back home. A taste of familiar snacks, a book from your favourite author, or even just a handwritten letter can be a real morale booster when you're feeling homesick.\n\n* **Finding unique treasures:** Living abroad opens up a world of unique goods and crafts.

I once had a package disappear somewhere between Thailand and Spain, never to be seen again. It was frustrating, to say the least. Always opt for tracked shipping and keep a close eye on your package's journey.\n\n**My Top Tips:**\n\n* **Plan ahead:** Don't leave shipping to the last minute. Allow ample time for processing and transit, especially during peak seasons.\n* **Pack carefully:** Use sturdy packaging materials and clearly label your package with your full name and address.\n\n* **Declare everything accurately:** Be honest about the contents of your package and its value.

It's an investment worth making to avoid headaches down the line.\n* **Understand Double Taxation Treaties:** Many countries have agreements to prevent you from being taxed twice on the same income. These treaties can be complex, but your tax advisor can help you understand how they apply to you.\n* **Keep Meticulous Records:** This is crucial! Keep track of everything – income, expenses, residency dates, bank statements, you name it. Having organized records makes tax time much smoother and can help you identify potential deductions.\n* **Stay Informed:** Tax laws change constantly. Make it a habit to stay up-to-date on any changes that might affect your situation. Subscribe to expat newsletters, follow relevant online forums, and check your home country's embassy website for updates.\n\nIt's definitely not easy, but remember, the rewards of living abroad are immense. Experiencing new cultures, broadening your horizons, and building a life in a new place are all worth the effort. Just make sure you're prepared to handle the administrative side of things, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it."}], "question_index": 7, "question": "How do you handle tax obligations across multiple countries?"}

Locals appreciate the effort, and it opens doors to genuine connections.\n\n**3.

Find activities that genuinely interest you, and you'll naturally meet like-minded people.\n\n**4. Be a regular:**\n\nFrequent the same cafes, shops, or parks. Familiarity breeds comfort, and you might start recognizing faces and striking up conversations.\n\n**5.

Be patient:**\n\nBuilding meaningful friendships takes time. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight.\n\n**8. Be open-minded and adaptable:**\n\nEmbrace the differences and be willing to step outside your comfort zone. You might be surprised by the friendships that bloom.\n\n**Remember, making friends abroad is a journey, not a destination. Enjoy the ride, embrace the challenges, and celebrate the rewards.

Don't just rely on glossy travel brochures or Instagram feeds. Dig deeper. Research the cost of living, visa requirements, healthcare system, cultural norms, and even the local weather patterns. \n\n**2.

Neglecting your finances:**\n\nMoving abroad can be expensive. Set a budget, track your spending, and be aware of hidden costs like currency exchange rates and international transfer fees.\n\n**8. Forgetting about visa renewals:**\n\nThis one is a biggie. Keep track of your visa status and start the renewal process well in advance. The last thing you want is to be caught out with an expired visa.\n\n**9. Not taking care of your mental health:**\n\nMoving abroad can be stressful.

We shifted to emails, voice notes, and scheduled video calls. This way, we could connect without the pressure of being \"live\" at the same time.\n\n* **Find your overlap:** Even with a big difference, there's usually a small window where our days align.

As someone who's bounced around the globe a few times, I've seen both sides of this coin. It's not a simple answer, really. It depends entirely on your child, your family, and your priorities.\n\n**Let's start with the international schools:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Familiar Curriculum:**  Often follow internationally recognized curriculums like the IB or American system, which can be a smoother transition if you're moving frequently.\n* **Multicultural Environment:**  A melting pot of cultures, languages, and perspectives. Your kids will learn to be global citizens, which is invaluable in today's world.\n* **English Language Focus:**  Usually English is the primary language of instruction, which can be a big plus for expat families.\n* **Strong Extracurriculars:** Often have well-funded sports, arts, and clubs, providing a well-rounded experience.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Cost:**  Can be *very* expensive, sometimes rivaling private school tuition back home.\n* **Bubble Effect:** Can sometimes feel isolated from the local community and culture.\n* **Less Local Language Exposure:** Your child might not develop fluency in the local language as quickly.\n\n**Now, let's look at local schools:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Immersion in Local Culture:** The best way for your child to learn the language, customs, and traditions of their new home.\n* **Affordability:** Significantly cheaper than international schools.\n* **Integration with Locals:**  Your child will build friendships and connections with local children.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Language Barrier:**  Can be a significant hurdle, especially in the beginning.\n* **Curriculum Differences:**  May not align with your home country's educational system, potentially requiring adjustments later on.\n* **Less Support for Expat Families:**  May not have the same level of support for students who are new to the country.\n\n**Ultimately, the best choice depends on your family's unique circumstances.**\n\n* **Consider your child's age and personality:** Younger children may adapt more easily to a local school, while older children might benefit from the familiarity of an international setting.\n* **Think about your long-term plans:** If you're planning to stay in the country for a long time, a local school might be a better option for cultural integration.

It's a minefield, isn't it? Like navigating a bustling market in a foreign city - exciting, a bit overwhelming, and you're constantly worried about accidentally stepping on someone's toes, figuratively speaking of course!\n\nI've been living abroad for almost a decade now, and I've learned a few things along the way.\n\n**Firstly, humility is key.**  Never assume your way is the right way. What's considered polite and professional in your home country might be seen as rude or even offensive elsewhere.\n\n**Secondly, do your research.** Before any major meeting or negotiation, I make sure to understand the local customs.\n\n* **Greetings:** Do they shake hands, bow, or kiss on both cheeks?\n* **Business cards:** Are they essential? How should they be presented and received?\n* **Communication style:** Are they direct or indirect? Formal or informal?\n\n**Thirdly, observe and adapt.** Pay attention to how locals interact with each other. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and communication style. Try to mirror their behavior, but always with respect and authenticity.\n\n**Fourthly, don't be afraid to ask questions.** If you're unsure about something, politely ask for clarification. It's better to ask than to make a faux pas.\n\n**Finally, be patient and understanding.** Remember that everyone is learning and adapting. Mistakes will happen, but the key is to learn from them and move forward.\n\nOne experience that comes to mind was when I was negotiating a contract in Japan. I was used to a more direct, confrontational style of negotiation. However, I quickly realized that this approach was not going to work in Japan. I had to be more patient, build rapport, and let the negotiations unfold gradually. It was a learning curve, but ultimately, it led to a successful outcome.\n\nLiving abroad has taught me so much about different cultures and myself. It's challenging, yes, but the rewards are immeasurable. You gain a broader perspective, develop invaluable intercultural skills, and build meaningful connections with people from all walks of life. And, of course, you get to experience the world in all its glorious diversity."}], "question_index": 23, "question": "How do you handle cultural differences in business etiquette?"}

It's good to get a balanced view, so I try to pick sources with different perspectives.\n\n* **Social media:**\n\nI follow friends, family, and news outlets on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

Understand the typical rental/buying process, average prices, and neighborhoods that suit your lifestyle.\n* **Network:** Reach out to your network - friends, colleagues, online communities - for recommendations or connections. Personal referrals can be invaluable.\n* **Consider temporary housing:** Book a short-term rental (Airbnb, serviced apartment) for your initial arrival. This gives you time to explore neighborhoods, understand local transportation, and get a feel for the city before committing to a long-term lease.\n\n**On the Ground:**\n\n* **Local expertise is key:** Connect with a reputable local real estate agent or relocation consultant. They understand the nuances of the market, can help you navigate language barriers, and negotiate on your behalf.\n* **Don't be afraid to haggle:** In many cultures, negotiation is expected, especially for rentals. Be polite but firm, and don't be afraid to walk away if the terms aren't favorable.\n* **Understand the legalities:** Familiarize yourself with local tenancy laws, lease agreements, and deposit requirements. Seek legal advice if needed to ensure your rights are protected.\n* **Inspect thoroughly:** Before signing anything, inspect the property carefully, noting any existing damage. Take photos and document everything.\n* **Factor in hidden costs:** Consider utilities, internet, transportation, and other ongoing expenses when budgeting for housing.\n\n**Cultural Considerations:**\n\n* **Be open-minded:** Housing standards and expectations vary widely across cultures. What's considered \"normal\" in one country may be different in another. Be prepared to adapt.\n* **Respect local customs:** Be mindful of cultural norms during viewings and interactions with landlords. Dress appropriately, be punctual, and show respect.\n* **Learn basic phrases:** Knowing a few basic phrases in the local language can go a long way in building rapport and making the process smoother.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Patience is key:** Finding the right housing can take time. Don't rush into a decision.\n* **Trust your gut:** If something feels off, it probably is.

It's that feeling of disorientation and discomfort that comes from being immersed in a completely new environment with different customs, social norms, and ways of life. It can manifest in many ways - from feeling homesick and isolated to struggling to understand basic interactions or even feeling overwhelmed by sensory overload.\n\n**2. Language Barrier:** Even if you speak the local language to some extent, there will always be nuances and colloquialisms you won't grasp immediately. This can make everyday tasks, like ordering food or asking for directions, surprisingly challenging. It can also lead to misunderstandings and feelings of frustration.\n\n**3. Bureaucracy and Paperwork:** Navigating a foreign bureaucracy can be a nightmare. From visa applications and residency permits to opening a bank account or getting a driver's license, the processes can be complex, time-consuming, and require a lot of patience.\n\n**4. Loneliness and Homesickness:**\n\nBeing away from family and friends can be tough. It's normal to miss familiar faces, traditions, and the comfort of your support network. Building a new social circle takes time and effort, and it can be isolating in the beginning.\n\n**5. Financial Adjustments:** The cost of living can vary drastically from country to country. You might find yourself adjusting to a new currency, dealing with different banking systems, and budgeting for unexpected expenses.\n\n**6. Adapting to Different Work Cultures:**\n\nWorkplace norms and expectations can be vastly different abroad. You might encounter different communication styles, hierarchies, and work-life balance philosophies.\n\n**7. Health and Safety Concerns:**\n\nEvery country has its own healthcare system and safety considerations. You'll need to research and understand these beforehand, and potentially adjust your lifestyle accordingly.\n\n**8. Reverse Culture Shock:**\n\nBelieve it or not, returning home after living abroad can also be a challenge. You may find that you've changed and grown, and that your home country no longer feels quite the same.\n\nDespite these challenges, I wouldn't trade my experiences living abroad for anything.

It just means you're human. Be patient with yourself, be kind to yourself, and remember that you're not alone. This too shall pass, and you'll emerge stronger and more resilient on the other side.

We share stories about our weeks, they get to see my little apartment and meet my new friends, and I get to hear about what's happening back home. I'm also part of a WhatsApp group with my closest friends, so we're constantly sharing photos, memes, and updates.\n\nOf course, it's not the same as being there.

I try to go back home at least once a year, and my friends and family have come to visit me here.\n\nIt's a lot of work, maintaining these connections across continents, but it's worth it.

Get a feel for neighborhoods, average rental costs, and common scams.\n\n* **Connect with your network:** Do you know anyone who's lived in your new country? Reach out! Even a distant acquaintance can offer valuable insights or leads.\n\n* **Consider temporary housing:** Book a short-term rental (Airbnb, serviced apartment) for your initial arrival. This gives you time to explore neighborhoods and get a feel for the place before committing to a long-term lease.\n\n**Once you're on the ground:**\n\n* **Be prepared to move fast:** The good places go quickly, especially in popular cities. Be ready to make a decision (and potentially put down a deposit) sooner than you might be used to.\n\n* **Don't be afraid to negotiate:** Rental prices are often negotiable, especially if you're signing a longer lease. Don't be shy about asking for a better deal.\n\n* **Learn some basic phrases:** Knowing a few key phrases in the local language can be incredibly helpful when interacting with landlords and agents.\n\n* **Trust your gut:** If something feels off, it probably is. Don't be pressured into signing a lease if you're not comfortable with the terms or the landlord.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Safety first:** Prioritize safe neighborhoods and well-lit areas.\n* **Factor in transportation:** Consider your commute to work or school when choosing a location.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** Local friends, colleagues, or even your embassy can be invaluable resources.\n\nFinding housing in a new country can be a challenge, but it's also an exciting adventure.

Don't get discouraged if you don't land your dream job right away. Stay positive, keep networking, and keep applying.\n\n**6. Consider alternative paths:**\n\nDon't limit yourself to traditional employment. Explore freelance work, volunteering, or starting your own business. Sometimes, the most fulfilling opportunities arise from unexpected places.\n\n**7. Don't underestimate the power of cultural immersion:**\n\nTake the time to learn about the local customs, traditions, and business etiquette. This will not only help you navigate the job market but also make your transition smoother overall.\n\nRemember, moving to a new country is a journey, not a destination.

This will save you headaches down the line if you need to prove you've done everything by the book.\n\n**5. Don't be afraid to ask for help:**  Don't suffer in silence! If you're struggling, reach out to expat communities online or in person. There's a wealth of experience and advice out there, and chances are someone has been in your shoes before.\n\n**6. Know your rights:** Every country has laws protecting residents, even foreigners. Familiarize yourself with these and don't be afraid to assert them if you feel you're being treated unfairly.\n\n**7. Celebrate the small victories:**  Dealing with bureaucracy can be draining. So when you finally get that visa approved or that document stamped, take a moment to celebrate! It's a reminder that you're making progress and conquering the system, one step at a time.\n\nRemember, bureaucracy is a challenge, but it's not insurmountable.

My kids could continue their education in English, which was a huge relief, especially in the early years. They were surrounded by other expat kids, which helped with the transition and made making friends easier. Plus, the curriculum was often more internationally focused, exposing them to different cultures and perspectives.\n\nBut, there were downsides too. It could feel like a bubble, a little too detached from the local culture. My kids missed out on fully immersing themselves in the language and traditions of their new home.

My kids learned the local language, made friends with local children, and truly became part of the community. They gained a deep understanding of the culture, which I think is invaluable.\n\nHowever, the language barrier was a major challenge, especially in the beginning. It took a lot of extra effort on our part to support them.
